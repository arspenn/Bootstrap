# Bootstrap Project History Summary

## Overview

Bootstrap is an AI Development Framework that evolved from a simple Claude AI bootstrap template into a comprehensive development framework. The project follows a design-first philosophy with structured workflows for feature development.

## Major Feature Additions

### v0.1.0 - Initial Bootstrap Template
- **Commit**: b8964e0
- **Features**:
  - Design-first workflow with three core commands: `design-feature`, `generate-prp`, `execute-prp`
  - Core project files: CLAUDE.md, PLANNING.md, TASK.md
  - Feature template system for standardized development

### v0.2.0 - Git Control Rules System
- **Commit**: c9d297b
- **Features**:
  - One rule per file architecture
  - Five core Git safety rules:
    - `git-add-safety`: Prevents accidental staging
    - `git-commit-format`: Enforces Conventional Commits
    - `git-push-validation`: Pre-push safety checks
    - `git-pull-strategy`: Smart rebase/merge strategies
    - `git-branch-naming`: Structured branch names
  - User preferences system for rule customization

### v0.3.0 - Claude Memory Integration
- **Commit**: fd47d3b
- **Features**:
  - 83.6% token reduction (5,400 to 900 tokens)
  - @import mechanism for efficient rule loading
  - MASTER_IMPORTS.md as single import point
  - Separated rule instructions from documentation

### v0.4.0 - Changelog Management System
- **Commit**: 7938310
- **Features**:
  - Semi-automated changelog approach
  - Three management rules:
    - `changelog-update`: Reminds about changelog updates
    - `changelog-format`: Validates Keep a Changelog format
    - `version-management`: Handles semantic versioning
  - Integration with task completion workflow

### v0.5.0 - Git-Safe File Operations
- **Commit**: 2b44800
- **Features**:
  - Prevents accidental data loss by intercepting dangerous commands
  - Suggests git-safe alternatives (git rm, git mv)
  - Blocks operations on files with uncommitted changes
  - Provides `--force-unsafe` override option
  - Standardized design folder structure: `{sequence}-{type}-{description}/`

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Git Rules Architecture
- **Decision**: One rule per file under `.claude/rules/`
- **Rationale**: Scalability, clarity, security, maintainability
- **Impact**: Unlimited rule categories without directory clutter

### ADR-006: Pivot to AI Development Framework
- **Decision**: Bootstrap is not just Git rules, but a comprehensive AI framework
- **Vision**: Compete with frameworks like SuperClaude with cleaner architecture
- **Strategy**: Use Git rules as foundation, expand to full development lifecycle

### ADR-007: Changelog Automation Level
- **Decision**: Semi-automated changelog system
- **Balance**: Human judgment for quality with tool assistance
- **Implementation**: Rule-based reminders + templates + manual updates

### Design-Specific ADRs (Git-Safe Operations)
- **ADR-001**: No automatic fallback to unsafe operations
- **ADR-002**: Medium security level for user override capability
- **ADR-003**: Path-specific git status checks for performance

## Technical Architecture

### Rule System Structure
```
.claude/
├── MASTER_IMPORTS.md      # Single import point
├── rules/
│   ├── git/              # Git control rules
│   ├── project/          # Project management rules
│   └── config/           # User preferences
```

### Key Design Principles
1. **No Magic**: Explicit over implicit operations
2. **Safety First**: Default to safe operations
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity as needed
4. **Clean Imports**: No complex YAML anchors or references
5. **User Empowerment**: Immutable rules with preference overrides

## Project Evolution Timeline

1. **Foundation Phase**: Basic template with design workflow
2. **Git Safety Phase**: Comprehensive Git control rules
3. **Optimization Phase**: Token reduction through memory integration
4. **Management Phase**: Changelog and version management
5. **Protection Phase**: Git-safe file operations
6. **Vision Expansion**: Pivot to comprehensive AI framework

## Future Roadmap Highlights

The project has a 10-phase roadmap including:
- **Phase 2**: Git completion (merge rules, tags, checkpoints)
- **Phase 3**: Command abstraction layer
- **Phase 4**: Core commands (/build, /test, /review, /analyze)
- **Phase 5**: AI personas system
- **Phase 6**: MCP integration
- **Phase 7-10**: Enterprise features and ecosystem building

## Innovation Points

1. **Token Efficiency**: 83.6% reduction through smart architecture
2. **Design-First**: Comprehensive design documents before implementation
3. **Rule Modularity**: One rule per file for maximum flexibility
4. **Safety by Default**: Git-safe operations prevent data loss
5. **Hybrid Approach**: Learning from competitors while maintaining clean architecture

## Conclusion

Bootstrap demonstrates thoughtful evolution from a simple template to a comprehensive AI development framework, maintaining architectural consistency throughout its growth while addressing real developer pain points with innovative solutions.
