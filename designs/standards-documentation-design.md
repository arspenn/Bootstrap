# Standards Documentation Design

## Executive Summary

This design document outlines the creation of STANDARDS.md, a centralized reference for all standards and specifications used in the Bootstrap project. This ensures version tracking, easy updates, and clear understanding of project conventions.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Document all adopted standards with version numbers
- Provide links to official specifications
- Track when standards were adopted
- Note any project-specific deviations
- Enable easy updates when standards evolve

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Must be easily scannable
- Should prevent standards drift
- Must integrate with existing documentation
- Should support future standard additions

## Current State Analysis

### Standards Currently in Use
1. **Conventional Commits v1.0.0** - Documented in ADR-002
2. **Keep a Changelog** - To be adopted for CHANGELOG.md
3. **Semantic Versioning** - Implied but not documented
4. **Git Flow** - Partially implemented via branch naming

### Gaps
- No central standards reference
- Version numbers not tracked
- Adoption dates not recorded
- Deviations not documented
