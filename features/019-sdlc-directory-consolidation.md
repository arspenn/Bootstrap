# Feature: SDLC Directory Consolidation

**Date**: 2025-09-01
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Requirements Gathered
**INVEST Score**: I:✓ N:✓ V:✓ E:✓ S:✓ T:✓
**Ambiguity Level**: Low
**Completeness**: 100%

## User Story

As a framework developer
I want to consolidate all SDLC-generated files into a single .sdlc directory
So that the project root stays clean and organized for alpha release

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Creating New Feature
- **Given** I run `/gather-feature-requirements`
- **When** the feature file is created
- **Then** it's saved to `.sdlc/features/###-name.md`

### Scenario 2: Creating New Design
- **Given** I run `/design-feature`
- **When** the design is created
- **Then** it's saved to `.sdlc/designs/###-name/design.md`

### Scenario 3: Creating New PRP
- **Given** I run `/generate-prp`
- **When** the PRP is created
- **Then** it's saved to `.sdlc/PRPs/name.md`

### Scenario 4: Framework Rules Enforcement
- **Given** a rule references file locations
- **When** the rule is applied
- **Then** it uses the new .sdlc directory paths

### Scenario 5: ADR Management
- **Given** ADRs exist in docs/ADRs/
- **When** the consolidation is complete
- **Then** ADRs are moved to `.sdlc/ADRs/` with git history preserved

## Boundaries and Constraints

### Out of Scope
- Migration scripts for external projects (pre-alpha)
- Moving docs/ directory (stays at root)
- Moving README.md, CHANGELOG.md, TASK.md (stay at root)
- Moving benchmarks/, responses/, temp/, tests/ directories
- Moving .claude/ directory

### System Limits
- Must preserve git history when moving files
- Must maintain sequential numbering in features/ and designs/
- Must update all path references atomically

### Edge Cases
- Existing ADRs in design-specific folders remain in place
- Empty directories should be removed after moving

## Dependencies

### Requires (Upstream)
- Git for history preservation
- File system permissions for directory creation

### Required By (Downstream)
- All feature creation commands
- All design creation commands
- All PRP generation commands
- ADR management rules

### Integration Points
- .claude/commands/ (multiple command files)
- .claude/rules/project/ (multiple rule files)
- .claude/config.yaml
- .claude/templates/ (feature templates)

## Additional Context

### Directories to Move
1. **features/** → **.sdlc/features/**
2. **designs/** → **.sdlc/designs/**
3. **PRPs/** → **.sdlc/PRPs/**
4. **docs/ADRs/** → **.sdlc/ADRs/**

### Files/Commands to Update (minimum 20+ files identified)
- .claude/rules/project/adr-management.md
- .claude/docs/rules/project/adr-management.md
- .claude/commands/generate-prp.md
- .claude/commands/gather-feature-requirements.md
- .claude/commands/quick-feature.md
- .claude/commands/design-feature.md
- .claude/rules/project/sequential-file-naming.md
- .claude/rules/project/design-structure.md
- .claude/config.yaml
- All feature templates referencing paths

### Existing ADRs to Validate and Move
1. ADR-001-git-rules-architecture.md
2. ADR-002-git-commit-standards.md
3. ADR-003-branching-strategy.md
4. ADR-004-rule-instruction-separation.md
5. ADR-005-master-import-strategy.md
6. ADR-006-comprehensive-framework-pivot.md
7. ADR-007-changelog-automation-level.md
8. ADR-008-design-numbering-convention.md
9. ADR-009-no-automatic-fallback-principle.md

## Technical Considerations

- Use `git mv` to preserve history for all moves
- Create .sdlc directory before moving files
- Update .gitignore if needed for .sdlc patterns
- Ensure all commands handle new paths correctly
- Test that sequential numbering still works

## Open Questions

- Should we add a README.md in .sdlc/ explaining the structure?
- Should .sdlc be added to any ignore patterns?
- Do we need to update any CI/CD configurations?
