# Feature: Git Merge Control Rules

**Date**: 2025-07-12
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive Git merge control rules to ensure safe and consistent merge operations. This feature addresses the critical gap in our Git control system by providing guidance for merge conflicts, merge strategies, and integration workflows.

## Problem Statement

Currently, our Git control rules cover add, commit, push, pull, and branch operations, but lack guidance for:
- Merge conflict resolution
- Merge strategy selection
- Integration branch management
- Feature branch merging
- Hotfix procedures
- Release merging workflows

This gap leaves users without safety rails during one of Git's most complex and error-prone operations.

## Proposed Solution

Create merge control rules that:
1. Guide merge strategy selection (merge, rebase, squash)
2. Enforce pre-merge validations
3. Provide conflict resolution guidance
4. Ensure clean merge commit messages
5. Validate post-merge state
6. Handle special cases (hotfixes, releases)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] git-merge-strategy rule created
- [ ] git-merge-conflict rule created  
- [ ] git-merge-validation rule created
- [ ] Integration with existing pull/push rules
- [ ] Clear documentation for merge workflows
- [ ] Conflict resolution best practices
- [ ] Automated merge safety checks

## Technical Design

### New Rules

1. **git-merge-strategy.md**
   - Default merge strategies per branch type
   - When to use --no-ff vs fast-forward
   - Squash merge guidelines
   - Rebase vs merge decision tree

2. **git-merge-conflict.md**
   - Conflict detection and reporting
   - Resolution workflow enforcement
   - Marker cleanup validation
   - Testing requirements post-conflict

3. **git-merge-validation.md**
   - Pre-merge checks (up-to-date, conflicts)
   - Post-merge validation (tests, build)
   - Merge commit message format
   - Integration branch protection

### Integration Points

- Works with git-pull-strategy for fetch-before-merge
- Complements git-push-validation for post-merge pushes
- Uses git-commit-format for merge commit messages
- Respects git-branch-naming for branch relationships

## User Experience

### Basic Merge Flow
```bash
# Claude ensures safe merging
git checkout main
git merge feature/auth-ad87b9f

# Claude validates:
# - Main is up-to-date
# - No conflicts exist
# - Tests pass on feature branch
# - Merge commit follows format
```

### Conflict Resolution Flow
```bash
# When conflicts occur
git merge feature/conflicting

# Claude guides:
# - Lists conflicting files
# - Suggests resolution strategies
# - Ensures markers are removed
# - Requires test validation
```

## Implementation Plan

1. Research existing merge best practices
2. Design rule YAML structures
3. Create instruction files
4. Write comprehensive documentation
5. Add merge scenarios to examples
6. Test with various merge situations
7. Integrate with existing rules

## Future Enhancements

- Automated conflict resolution for simple cases
- Integration with CI/CD merge checks
- Merge request/PR integration
- Team-specific merge policies
- Merge history analysis

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk**: Over-restrictive rules blocking valid merges
  - **Mitigation**: Configurable strictness levels
  
- **Risk**: Complex conflict scenarios
  - **Mitigation**: Clear escalation paths
  
- **Risk**: Performance impact on large merges
  - **Mitigation**: Optimized validation checks

## Dependencies

- Existing Git control rules framework
- User preferences system
- Import/documentation structure

## Design Resources

Essential documentation to inform the design:

1. **Git Official Documentation**
   - [Git Branching - Basic Branching and Merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)
   - [git-merge Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge)
   - [Git Branching - Rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)

2. **Atlassian Git Tutorials**
   - [Using Branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches)
   - [Merging vs Rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)

### Key Concepts to Extract

From these resources, we should focus on:
- Three-way merge mechanics
- Fast-forward vs no-fast-forward merges
- Merge conflict resolution workflows
- Rebase vs merge decision criteria
- Interactive rebase safety
- Merge strategies (recursive, octopus, ours, subtree)
- Best practices for different workflows

## Questions to Resolve

1. Should we enforce linear history by default?
2. How to handle merge commits vs squash merges?
3. Should different branch types have different merge rules?
4. How to integrate with GitHub/GitLab merge requests?
5. What level of automation is appropriate?

## Acceptance Criteria

- All merge operations guided by rules
- No loss of work during conflicts
- Clear audit trail of merge decisions
- Reduced merge-related errors
- Improved team consistency

## Notes

This feature is critical for team collaboration and should be prioritized immediately after the memory integration work. It fills the most significant gap in our current Git control coverage.
