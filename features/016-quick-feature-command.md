# Feature: Quick Feature Command

**Date**: 2025-09-01
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Requirements Gathered
**INVEST Score**: I:✓ N:✓ V:✓ E:✓ S:✓ T:✓
**Ambiguity Level**: Low
**Completeness**: 95%

## User Story

As a developer and end-user of the Bootstrap framework
I want to implement a streamlined /quick-feature command
So that I can rapidly define small features like fixes, documentation changes, or prototypes without excessive overhead

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Basic Quick Feature Creation
- **Given** A developer needs to quickly define a small feature
- **When** They run `/quick-feature` with minimal input
- **Then** A feature file is generated with just essential fields for design-feature

### Scenario 2: Complexity Detection
- **Given** A developer provides a feature requiring multiple file changes or test updates
- **When** The system analyzes the requirements
- **Then** It suggests using the full gather-feature-requirements command with a detailed context summary

### Scenario 3: Template Creation
- **Given** The quick-feature command needs to generate feature files
- **When** Creating output
- **Then** It uses a minimal template that's still compatible with design-feature command

## Boundaries and Constraints

### Out of Scope
- Complex multi-component features
- Features requiring extensive design documentation
- Breaking changes or major refactors

### In Scope
- Bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Small enhancements
- Prototypes
- Single-file changes (preferred)

### System Limits
- Should generate feature request with minimal metadata
- Must remain compatible with design-feature command
- Should complete in 2-3 questions maximum when interactive

### Edge Cases
- When input has sufficient information, generate immediately without questions
- When complexity exceeds threshold (2+ files), suggest full command with context
- When test changes detected, add additional acceptance criteria automatically

## Dependencies

### Requires (Upstream)
- `/gather-feature-requirements` command (as reference implementation)
- Feature file templates (to be created)
- `/design-feature` command compatibility

### Required By (Downstream)
- Future rapid development workflows
- Quick fix processes
- Documentation update workflows

### Integration Points
- Feature file format must be parseable by design-feature
- Command system in .claude/commands/
- Template system in .claude/templates/

## Additional Context

This command is based on the existing /gather-feature-requirements command but streamlined for small, quick features. It should intelligently detect when a feature is too complex and guide users to the full requirements gathering process while preserving their work.

The command should be smart about detecting when unit tests are needed and adjust the acceptance criteria accordingly, while still maintaining its "quick" nature for truly simple changes.

## Technical Considerations

- Use Claude's analysis to detect feature complexity
- Leverage existing template system
- Ensure backward compatibility with design-feature command
- No special file naming or directory structure for quick features
- Preserve context when escalating to full requirements gathering

## Open Questions

- None at this time
