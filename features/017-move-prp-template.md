# Feature: Move PRP Template to .claude/templates

**Date**: 2025-09-01
**Priority**: Low
**Status**: Requirements Gathered

## User Story

As a developer
I want to move the PRP template to .claude/templates directory
So that all templates are centralized in one location

## Description

Move the PRP template from PRPs/templates/prp_base.md to .claude/templates/prp_base.md and update all references to the new location. This consolidates all templates in the standard .claude/templates directory following the project's convention.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Given** the PRP template exists at PRPs/templates/prp_base.md
- **When** the migration is executed
- **Then** the template is moved to .claude/templates/prp_base.md

- **Given** the generate-prp command references the old location
- **When** the command is updated
- **Then** it references the new location at .claude/templates/prp_base.md

## Technical Context

- Current location: PRPs/templates/prp_base.md
- New location: .claude/templates/prp_base.md
- File to update: .claude/commands/generate-prp.md
- Any PRPs or documentation that reference the template location
