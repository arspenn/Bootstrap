# Phase One: Incremental Requirements Gathering Implementation

## Overview
Incremental implementation focusing on rapid value delivery, starting with feature-level requirements to enable immediate use in Bootstrap development itself.

## Step 1: Basic Feature Requirements Command (Week 1)

### Command: `/gather-feature-requirements`

**Minimal Viable Scope:**
- Simple conversational flow to capture user stories
- Basic template output matching existing feature request format
- Focus on the essential "As a... I want... So that..." pattern

**Conversation Pattern:**
Follow the structure from Mike Cohn's User Stories Applied:
1. Role identification
2. Feature/desire statement  
3. Benefit/value articulation
4. Basic acceptance criteria (minimum 2)

**Output Template:**
Use existing Bootstrap feature request template with:
- Title
- User story
- Acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then format)
- Priority (default to "Should Have" if unclear)

**Reference Implementation:**
Atlassian's user story examples demonstrate this conversational flow effectively: [Atlassian User Stories with Examples](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories)

**Success Indicator:** 
Generate first usable feature request within 5 minutes of conversation.

## Step 2: Enhanced Feature Requirements (Week 2)

### Enhancements to `/gather-feature-requirements`

**Add Structured Elicitation:**
- Multiple stakeholder perspectives using Viewpoint-Oriented Requirements (Sommerville approach)
- Boundary questions: "What is NOT included in this feature?"
- Dependency detection: "Does this relate to any existing features?"

**Quality Improvements:**
- Ambiguity detection for common vague terms
- Suggest concrete replacements (e.g., "fast" → "under 2 seconds")
- INVEST criteria checklist (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)

**Pattern Reference:**
The EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) provides templates for clear requirement statements: [EARS Tutorial](https://alistairmavin.com/ears/)

## Step 3: Basic Project Requirements (Week 3)

### Command: `/gather-project-requirements`

**Minimal Scope:**
- Core questions only: What, Who, Why
- Generate simple PLANNING.md with 5 sections maximum
- Target output: 500-750 words

**Essential Sections:**
1. **Purpose** (1-2 paragraphs)
2. **Users** (bullet list)
3. **Core Features** (3-5 items)
4. **Constraints** (technical/business)
5. **Success Metrics** (2-3 measurable outcomes)

**Conversation Pattern:**
Based on Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE):
1. Start with goals, not solutions
2. Identify stakeholders
3. Define success criteria
4. Establish boundaries

**Reference Pattern:**
The Lean Canvas model provides a one-page project overview structure: [Lean Canvas Overview](https://leanstack.com/lean-canvas)

## Step 4: Project-Feature Integration (Week 4)

### Linking Commands

**Integration Points:**
- Feature requirements reference project goals from PLANNING.md
- Project requirements suggest initial features for elaboration
- Both commands check for existing project context

**Traceability Pattern:**
Simple parent-child linking:
- Project goals → Feature user stories
- Feature acceptance criteria → Project success metrics

**Reference Implementation:**
ReqView demonstrates lightweight traceability without complex tooling: [ReqView Traceability Guide](https://www.reqview.com/doc/traceability)

## Step 5: Validation and Refinement (Week 5)

### Quality Gates

**Completeness Checks:**
- Volere "Snow Card" pattern for individual requirements
- Each requirement has: rationale, fit criterion, source
- Reference: [Volere Snow Card](https://www.volere.org/templates/volere-snow-card/)

**Review Triggers:**
- Automatically suggest review when >5 requirements gathered
- Provide review checklist based on IEEE 29148-2018 simplified criteria
- Generate summary of potential issues found

**Pattern Reference:**
NASA's requirements checklist provides aerospace-grade validation in simplified form: [NASA Systems Engineering Handbook](https://www.nasa.gov/seh/appendix-c-how-to-write-a-good-requirement/)

## Documentation Requirements

### For Each Command:
1. **Help text** explaining the elicitation process
2. **Example conversations** showing good practices
3. **Templates** for common project types
4. **Anti-patterns** to avoid

### Reference Documentation:
- Link to IREB's free requirements templates
- Provide examples from successful open-source projects
- Include glossary of requirements terminology

## Metrics for Success

### Week 1 Target:
- First feature request generated and used for Step 2 development
- Time to complete: <10 minutes

### Week 2 Target:
- Feature requests include multiple perspectives
- Ambiguity score: <5% vague terms

### Week 3 Target:
- First PLANNING.md generated
- Covers all essential elements in <750 words

### Week 4 Target:
- Features traced to project goals
- Bidirectional navigation working

### Week 5 Target:
- 90% of requirements pass completeness check
- Review identifies real issues in test projects

## Key Resources for Implementation Patterns

### Conversational Requirements Gathering:
- **IBM Design Thinking Field Guide** - Interview question patterns
- **Google Design Sprint** - "How Might We" question format
- **IDEO Design Kit** - Human-centered elicitation methods

### Requirements Templates:
- **Volere Template** - Comprehensive but adaptable structure
- **IEEE 29148 Simplified** - Standards-based minimal template
- **Arc42** - Lightweight documentation structure

### Quality Patterns:
- **EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)** - Clear requirement writing
- **Planguage** - Tom Gilb's quantified requirement language
- **SMART Criteria** - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound

### Successful Implementation Examples:
- **Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals (KEPs)** - Structured feature proposals
- **Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)** - Clear problem-solution format
- **Rust RFCs** - Community-driven requirements process

## Incremental Delivery Schedule

| Week | Deliverable | Validation Method |
|------|------------|------------------|
| 1 | Basic `/gather-feature-requirements` | Use it for Week 2 features |
| 2 | Enhanced feature gathering | Use it for Week 3 features |
| 3 | Basic `/gather-project-requirements` | Generate Bootstrap PLANNING.md |
| 4 | Command integration | Trace Week 3-4 features to project |
| 5 | Quality validation | Review all prior requirements |

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
1. **Over-engineering early steps** - Keep Week 1 extremely simple
2. **Perfect templates** - Start with basic, improve iteratively
3. **Complex workflows** - Linear conversation first, branching later
4. **Excessive validation** - Add quality checks gradually

### Fallback Options:
- If conversation flow fails: Provide template for manual filling
- If integration complex: Keep commands independent initially
- If quality checks slow: Make them optional/async

## Next Phase Preview

Phase Two (Weeks 6-10) would add:
- Multiple elicitation techniques (scenarios, prototypes)
- Collaborative requirements (multiple stakeholders)
- Change management workflows
- Advanced analysis (conflicts, dependencies)

But Phase One must prove the core value proposition first: **Better requirements in less time**.
