# DIP: [FEATURE_NAME] - Phase [PHASE_NUMBER]

## Phase Overview

**Total Phases:** [TOTAL_PHASE_COUNT]
**Current Phase:** [PHASE_NUMBER] of [TOTAL_PHASE_COUNT]
**Phase Name:** [PHASE_NAME]
**Design Reference:** [DESIGN_DOCUMENT_PATH]
**Previous Phase:** [PREVIOUS_PHASE_DIP] (if applicable)
**Next Phase:** [NEXT_PHASE_DIP] (if applicable)

### Phase Objectives
[What this specific phase accomplishes]

### Phase Dependencies
- **Requires from Previous Phase:**
  - [DEPENDENCY_1]
  - [DEPENDENCY_2]
- **Provides for Next Phase:**
  - [OUTPUT_1]
  - [OUTPUT_2]

## Phase Scope

### This Phase Includes
✅ [IN_SCOPE_1]
✅ [IN_SCOPE_2]
✅ [IN_SCOPE_3]

### Deferred to Later Phases
⏭️ [DEFERRED_1] → Phase [PHASE_NUMBER]
⏭️ [DEFERRED_2] → Phase [PHASE_NUMBER]

## Implementation Tasks for This Phase

### Task 1: [TASK_NAME]
**Files:** [FILES_TO_MODIFY]
**Dependencies:** None / [DEPENDENCY_LIST]
```
[IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS]
```

### Task 2: [TASK_NAME]
**Files:** [FILES_TO_MODIFY]
**Dependencies:** Task 1 must be complete
```
[IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS]
```

### Task 3: [TASK_NAME]
**Files:** [FILES_TO_MODIFY]
**Dependencies:** Tasks 1, 2 must be complete
```
[IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS]
```

## Phase Validation

### Phase Checkpoint Tests
These tests verify this phase is complete before moving to next:

```[LANGUAGE]
def test_phase_[PHASE_NUMBER]_checkpoint_1():
    """Verify [WHAT_TO_VERIFY]"""
    [TEST_IMPLEMENTATION]

def test_phase_[PHASE_NUMBER]_checkpoint_2():
    """Verify [WHAT_TO_VERIFY]"""
    [TEST_IMPLEMENTATION]
```

### Phase Success Criteria
- [ ] [CRITERION_1]
- [ ] [CRITERION_2]
- [ ] [CRITERION_3]
- [ ] All phase checkpoint tests pass
- [ ] No regression in previous phase functionality

## Integration Points

### APIs/Interfaces Created This Phase
```[LANGUAGE]
[INTERFACE_DEFINITION]
```

### Temporary Scaffolding
Code that will be replaced in later phases:
```[LANGUAGE]
# TEMPORARY - Will be replaced in Phase [PHASE_NUMBER]
[TEMPORARY_CODE]
```

### Migration Notes
For transitioning to next phase:
- [MIGRATION_NOTE_1]
- [MIGRATION_NOTE_2]

## Phase-Specific Validation

### This Phase Only
```bash
# Run phase-specific tests
[TEST_COMMAND] tests/phase_[PHASE_NUMBER]/

# Expected: All pass
```

### Cumulative Validation
```bash
# Run all tests up to this phase
[TEST_COMMAND] tests/phase_1/ tests/phase_2/ ... tests/phase_[PHASE_NUMBER]/

# Expected: All pass, no regressions
```

## Rollback Strategy

### Phase Rollback
If this phase fails:
1. [ROLLBACK_STEP_1]
2. [ROLLBACK_STEP_2]
3. Return to Phase [PREVIOUS_PHASE_NUMBER] state

### Partial Completion Handling
If phase partially complete:
- Safe stopping point: After [TASK_NUMBER]
- Minimum viable: [MINIMUM_TASKS]
- Can defer: [DEFERRABLE_TASKS]

## Phase Completion Checklist

### Technical Completion
- [ ] All phase tasks implemented
- [ ] Phase checkpoint tests passing
- [ ] No regression in previous phases
- [ ] Performance within targets

### Process Completion
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated for this phase
- [ ] Next phase DIP reviewed and ready
- [ ] Stakeholders informed of phase completion

## Handoff to Next Phase

### What Next Phase Needs
- **Working Code:**
  - [COMPONENT_1] fully functional
  - [COMPONENT_2] tested and stable
- **Documentation:**
  - [DOC_1] updated
  - [DOC_2] created
- **Known Issues:**
  - [ISSUE_1] - Will address in Phase [PHASE_NUMBER]
  - [ISSUE_2] - Acceptable for now

### Next Phase Entry Criteria
Before starting Phase [NEXT_PHASE_NUMBER]:
- [ ] This phase fully complete
- [ ] All checkpoint tests passing
- [ ] Team capacity available
- [ ] Dependencies resolved
