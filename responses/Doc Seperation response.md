1. Do all of this at once. There should be no need to do this in phases unless it seems to be a better idea to move each group of documentations at the same time. Just be sure to create the files in the new location before you delete the old ones, or move the files themselves without editing, what ever would be most efficient.
2. References should be updated as part of this process
3. We should always be preserving git history
4. Framework docs should not be referencing project docs at all. The framework is supposed to be stand alone. The project files will be wiped clean when this framework is used in a new project. If a project doc references a framework doc use direct links as we have been.
5. For now we will rely on the IDE. We will put advanced documentation searching in future features of TASK.md
6. For now assume that everything in .claude will be included as is. But creation of a cleanup script to make the framework ready for a new project will be done at a later time.
7. That sounds like a neat idea at some point so add it to TASK.md, but don't include it now.
8. No, not unless there is a specific need. It would be better to standardize things as much as possible. In the end it would likely be up to who ever is using this framework to decide the template for documentation. As part of this process ensure that any templates that are used in .claude are added to that template folder also.
9. Versioning the documentation seems too complex at this point. As long as the Github history has the old versions of the files, it should be fine.
10. There is no need to add integration. But we need to note another future feature, to have Claude automatically decide to read the documentation if it needs more clarification.

Review these responses and ask if you have any further clarifications.
