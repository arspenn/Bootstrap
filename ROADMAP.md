# Bootstrap SDLC Framework Roadmap

## Vision

Bootstrap is a comprehensive AI-native SDLC framework that uses itself to build itself. Starting from Git safety controls, we're expanding to cover the entire software development lifecycle with structured workflows and intelligent automation.

## Core Principles

1. **Self-Bootstrapping**: Use the framework to develop the framework
2. **Token Efficiency**: Minimize context usage while maximizing functionality  
3. **Safety First**: Protective defaults with user override options
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity as needed
5. **Developer Control**: Automation without sacrificing flexibility

## Current Status (September 2025)

### Completed Features âœ…
- **Git Safety Rules**: add, commit, push, pull, branch controls
- **Rule System**: Modular rule architecture with priorities
- **Task Management**: Integrated task tracking with git commits
- **Requirements Commands**: Project and feature gathering
- **Template System**: 20+ reusable templates
- **Token Optimization**: 83.6% reduction achieved
- **Documentation Framework**: Comprehensive docs structure
- **SDLC Structure**: .sdlc/ directory organization

### Active Development ðŸš§
- **Template Consolidation**: Standardizing all templates
