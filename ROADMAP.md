# Bootstrap AI Development Framework Roadmap

## Vision

Bootstrap aims to become a comprehensive AI development framework that combines the best architectural patterns with powerful development automation. Starting with Git control rules as our foundation, we're building toward a complete suite of AI-assisted development tools.

## Core Principles

1. **Clean Architecture**: One rule/command per file with simple imports
2. **Token Efficiency**: Minimize context usage while maximizing functionality
3. **Security First**: Immutable rules with user preference overrides
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity as needed
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear documentation and intuitive patterns

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
**Status**: âœ… Complete

- [x] Git control rules (add, commit, push, pull, branch)
- [x] Claude memory integration with @import
- [x] Rule/documentation separation
- [x] 83.6% token reduction achieved
- [x] Testing framework established

### Phase 2: Git Completion (In Progress)
**Target**: Q1 2025

- [ ] Git merge control rules
  - [ ] git-merge-strategy
  - [ ] git-merge-conflict
  - [ ] git-merge-validation
- [ ] Git checkpoint system (inspired by SuperClaude)
- [ ] Tag management rules
- [ ] Pre-commit hook integration
- [ ] Advanced GitHub/GitLab functionality

### Phase 3: Command Abstraction Layer
**Target**: Q1 2025

- [ ] Command framework on top of rules
- [ ] High-level operations that combine multiple rules
- [ ] Flag inheritance system
- [ ] Command aliases for common workflows
- [ ] Interactive command builder

### Phase 4: Core Development Commands
**Target**: Q2 2025

Implement essential commands (Bootstrap pattern, SuperClaude inspired):

- [ ] `/build` - Build automation and orchestration
- [ ] `/test` - Comprehensive testing automation
- [ ] `/review` - AI-powered code review
- [ ] `/analyze` - Code analysis and metrics
- [ ] `/document` - Auto-documentation generation

### Phase 5: AI Personas & Intelligence
**Target**: Q2 2025

- [ ] Persona system (architect, security, frontend, etc.)
- [ ] Context-aware persona switching
- [ ] Persona-specific rule sets
- [ ] Collaborative persona interactions
- [ ] Learning from user preferences

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
**Target**: Q3 2025

- [ ] MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
- [ ] Agent suggestions for commits and code
- [ ] Conversation management rules
- [ ] Session persistence and recovery
- [ ] Token usage analytics and optimization

### Phase 7: Developer Workflow Integration
**Target**: Q3 2025

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration
- [ ] IDE plugin support
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Workflow patterns (Git Flow, GitHub Flow)
- [ ] Custom workflow definitions

### Phase 8: Extended Commands
**Target**: Q4 2025

Complete command suite:

- [ ] `/deploy` - Deployment automation
- [ ] `/migrate` - Database and code migrations
- [ ] `/troubleshoot` - Intelligent debugging
- [ ] `/estimate` - Project estimation
- [ ] `/spawn` - Project scaffolding

### Phase 9: Enterprise Features
**Target**: Q4 2025

- [ ] Team management and permissions
- [ ] Audit logging and compliance
- [ ] Custom rule creation UI
- [ ] Metrics and analytics dashboard
- [ ] Integration with enterprise tools

### Phase 10: Ecosystem & Community
**Target**: 2026

- [ ] Plugin architecture
- [ ] Community rule marketplace
- [ ] Rule sharing and versioning
- [ ] Template system for new projects
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation site

## Technical Milestones

### Near Term (Next 3 months)
1. Complete Git command suite
2. Implement command abstraction
3. Create first non-Git commands
4. Establish persona patterns

### Medium Term (3-6 months)
1. Full command coverage matching SuperClaude
2. MCP integration operational
3. Advanced AI features active
4. Beta release ready

### Long Term (6-12 months)
1. Enterprise features complete
2. Plugin ecosystem established
3. Community adoption growing
4. Version 1.0 release

## Success Metrics

- **Token Efficiency**: Maintain <10% overhead for rule imports
- **Rule Coverage**: 100% of common Git operations
- **Command Parity**: Match SuperClaude's 19 commands
- **User Adoption**: 1000+ active users
- **Community Contributions**: 50+ community rules

## Migration Path from SuperClaude

For users wanting to migrate:

1. **Rule Conversion Tool**: Convert SuperClaude YAML to Bootstrap rules
2. **Command Compatibility**: Support similar command syntax
3. **Persona Mapping**: Map SuperClaude personas to Bootstrap
4. **Migration Guide**: Step-by-step documentation

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Priority areas:

1. Git merge control rules (current focus)
2. Command abstraction design
3. Testing framework improvements
4. Documentation enhancements
5. Token optimization strategies

## Version Strategy

- **0.1.x**: Foundation and Git rules
- **0.2.x**: Command abstraction layer
- **0.3.x**: Core commands implementation
- **0.4.x**: AI personas
- **0.5.x**: MCP and advanced features
- **1.0.0**: Feature complete with enterprise support

## Notes

This roadmap is ambitious but achievable. By combining Bootstrap's clean architecture with proven concepts from projects like SuperClaude, we can create a best-in-class AI development framework that's both powerful and maintainable.

The hybrid approach allows us to move quickly by learning from existing solutions while maintaining our architectural advantages. Each phase builds on the previous, ensuring a stable foundation for growth.
