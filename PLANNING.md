# Bootstrap Project Planning

## Project Overview
This is a bootstrap template for software design and development with Claude AI, providing a structured workflow for designing features before implementation.

## Architecture
- **Command-based System**: Uses Claude commands for design, PRP generation, and execution
- **Document-driven Development**: Features start as markdown specifications
- **Modular Structure**: Organized into features/, designs/, PRPs/, and tests/
- **Convention-driven**: CLAUDE.md contains all project conventions

## Key Components
1. **Feature Templates**: Standardized format for feature requests
2. **Design Phase**: Interactive exploration with architecture decisions
3. **PRP Generation**: Detailed implementation plans from designs
4. **Execution Phase**: Implementation with validation

## Design Principles
- Design before implementation
- Document all decisions
- Maintain modularity
- Follow conventions strictly
- Test everything

## Future Enhancements
- Git control rules (completed)
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md conventions
- CI/CD integration
- Team collaboration patterns
- Conversation management rules for Claude Code --continue/--resume
  - Checkpoint creation rules
  - Context preservation standards
  - Resume workflow automation
