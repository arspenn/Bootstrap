# Bootstrap SDLC Framework Planning

## Project Overview

Bootstrap is a comprehensive AI-native Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) framework that covers the entire journey from initial ideation to post-deployment maintenance. It is designed to be self-improving, using its own functionality to build and enhance itself - hence the name "Bootstrap". The framework provides intelligent automation, safety controls, and structured workflows while maintaining developer flexibility and control.

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Complete SDLC Coverage** - Support every phase from pre-specification requirements gathering through post-deployment monitoring
2. **AI-Native Integration** - Deep integration with AI assistants, not just surface-level API calls
3. **Self-Bootstrapping Architecture** - Use the framework's own capabilities to develop and improve itself
4. **Developer Empowerment** - Provide safety rails and automation without sacrificing control or flexibility

### Secondary Goals
- Achieve 80% reduction in manual repetitive tasks across the SDLC
- Establish industry-standard patterns for AI-assisted development
- Create a framework that adapts to different team sizes and project types
- Build a community-driven ecosystem of rules, commands, and templates

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Software Development Teams** using AI assistants for development
- **Individual Developers** seeking structured AI-assisted workflows
- **DevOps Engineers** implementing automated deployment pipelines
- **Technical Leads** establishing team standards and practices

### Secondary Users
- **Product Managers** collaborating on requirements and specifications
- **QA Engineers** integrating testing throughout development
- **Enterprise Teams** requiring compliance and audit trails
- **Open Source Projects** needing consistent contribution standards

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope
- **Pre-Development Phase**
  - Requirements gathering and analysis
  - Feature discovery and prioritization
  - Stakeholder communication templates
  
- **Design & Architecture Phase**
  - Design document generation and management
  - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
  - Technical specification creation
  
- **Development Phase**
  - Git workflow automation and safety
  - Code generation with safety rails
  - Task management and tracking
  - Testing integration
  
- **Deployment & Maintenance Phase**
  - Deployment automation
  - Post-deployment monitoring hooks
  - Maintenance task scheduling
  - Performance optimization workflows

- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
  - AI behavior control and safety rules
  - Token optimization strategies
  - Documentation generation
  - Compliance and audit logging

### Out of Scope
- **Non-AI Development** - Manual coding without AI assistance
- **Project Management Tools** - Gantt charts, resource allocation
- **Communication Platforms** - Chat, video conferencing
- **Cloud Infrastructure Management** - Direct AWS/Azure/GCP provisioning
- **Financial/Budget Tracking** - Cost management and billing

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Token Efficiency**: Maintain <2000 tokens for full rule set loading
- **Command Response Time**: <500ms for command execution
- **Rule Coverage**: 100+ production-ready rules across all SDLC phases
- **Test Coverage**: >80% for critical framework components

### Adoption Metrics
- **Developer Productivity**: 5+ hours saved per developer per week
- **Error Prevention**: 90% reduction in common git mistakes
- **Onboarding Time**: New developers productive within 2 hours
- **Community Growth**: 50+ contributed rules/commands in first year

### Quality Metrics
- **Code Consistency**: 95% adherence to defined standards
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% of public APIs documented
- **Deployment Success Rate**: >99% successful deployments using framework
- **Bug Discovery**: Issues caught 50% earlier in development cycle

## Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity First** - Every rule, command, and template is independent
2. **Progressive Enhancement** - Start simple, add complexity as needed
3. **Token Efficiency** - Minimize context usage at every level
4. **Safety by Default** - Protective rules enabled out of the box
5. **User Override Authority** - Users can always override framework decisions
6. **Self-Documenting** - The framework documents its own development

## Technology Foundation

- **Primary Language**: Markdown for rules and documentation
- **Command System**: Claude-native commands with extensibility
- **Version Control**: Git-based with comprehensive safety rules
- **Testing**: Pytest for Python components, framework for rule testing
- **Documentation**: Self-generating from templates and rules

## Development Philosophy

- **Eat Your Own Dog Food** - Bootstrap must use itself for its own development
- **Community-Driven** - Open to contributions and feedback
- **Pragmatic Over Perfect** - Ship iteratively, improve continuously
- **Developer Experience First** - If it's not pleasant to use, it's not done
- **Transparent Operations** - Clear about what the framework is doing and why
