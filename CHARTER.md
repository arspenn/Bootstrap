# Bootstrap Framework Charter (Draft)

## Executive Summary
Bootstrap is a comprehensive framework for structured decision-making and project management, beginning with software development as its proving ground. While initially focused on AI-native Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) workflows, Bootstrap's ultimate vision extends to any domain requiring systematic planning, requirements gathering, design thinking, and implementation - from public health initiatives to policy development, event coordination to research projects. The framework embodies the principle of "eating your own dog food" by using its own capabilities to develop and improve itself.

The framework provides intelligent multi-agent AI orchestration, deterministic safety controls, and structured workflows while maintaining user flexibility and control. By establishing patterns in the well-defined domain of software development, Bootstrap creates reusable abstractions that can be adapted to less structured domains. Each command leverages specialized AI agents working in parallel to provide comprehensive analysis while maintaining a single point of user interaction through the Requirements Engineer role.

Bootstrap represents a new paradigm in AI-assisted work: moving from passive rule-based systems to active command-driven execution with embedded intelligence. The 4D+1 workflow (Init → Determine → Design → Define → Do) provides a universal pattern for tackling complex projects in any domain, with built-in safety mechanisms and progressive refinement capabilities.

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: AI-Native Multi-Agent Integration
Bootstrap is built from the ground up for AI agents, not retrofitted. Commands orchestrate specialized agents working in parallel, each bringing domain expertise while maintaining a single user interface through the Requirements Engineer role.
**Rationale:** AI collaboration amplifies capabilities beyond any single agent, providing comprehensive analysis while keeping user interaction simple and focused.

### Principle 2: Self-Bootstrapping Evolution
The framework uses its own capabilities to develop, test, and improve itself. Every enhancement to Bootstrap is created using Bootstrap's own commands and workflows.
**Rationale:** This ensures the framework remains practical and battle-tested - if Bootstrap can't build Bootstrap, it's not ready for other projects.

### Principle 3: Interactive User Sovereignty
Users maintain ultimate control through section-by-section interaction and approval loops. The framework guides but never dictates, with users able to override any decision or suggestion.
**Rationale:** Complex projects require human judgment, domain knowledge, and stakeholder input that no AI can fully replace. Progressive refinement with user feedback produces superior outcomes.

### Principle 4: Structured Flexibility
Simple, memorable workflows (4D+1: Init → Determine → Design → Define → Do) that adapt to project complexity. Commands accept arguments for customization while maintaining consistent patterns.
**Rationale:** Structure prevents chaos in complex projects while flexibility allows adaptation to unique needs, from simple bug fixes to enterprise transformations.

### Principle 5: Deterministic Safety
Critical operations use deterministic scripts, not AI interpretation. Git operations, file safety, and structural changes are handled by tested, predictable code.
**Rationale:** Some operations are too important to leave to AI interpretation. Deterministic scripts provide guaranteed behavior for critical safety operations.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives
- **Establish Universal Project Management Patterns**: Create the 4D+1 workflow as a reusable pattern for any domain requiring structured decision-making, starting with SDLC as the proving ground
- **Achieve 80% Reduction in Repetitive Work**: Automate routine tasks across project lifecycle while maintaining quality and safety standards
- **Enable Multi-Agent AI Orchestration**: Provide framework for coordinating specialized AI agents to tackle complex, multi-faceted problems

### Secondary Objectives
- Document patterns that could apply beyond software development
- Maintain clean, extensible architecture for future domain adaptations
- Build small community of early adopters and contributors

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope
- **SDLC Workflows**: Requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment phases
- **Multi-Agent AI Orchestration**: Coordinating specialized agents for complex analysis
- **Safety Controls**: Git operations, file safety, validation scripts
- **Documentation Generation**: Templates, artifacts, decision records
- **Interactive Commands**: The 4D+1 workflow with user feedback loops

### Out of Scope
- **Project Management Tools**: Gantt charts, resource allocation, budget tracking
- **Communication Platforms**: Chat, video, team collaboration tools
- **Direct Cloud Provisioning**: AWS/Azure/GCP infrastructure management
- **Non-AI Development**: Manual workflows without AI assistance

### Future Considerations
- Domain-specific adaptations (health, policy, events)
- Integration with external project management tools
- Advanced analytics and metrics dashboard

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Primary Language:** Markdown (commands, documentation, templates)
- **Scripts:** POSIX-compliant shell scripts (15+ deterministic operations)
- **Framework:** Claude Code with Task tool for multi-agent orchestration
- **Version Control:** Git with comprehensive safety rules
- **Target Projects:** Any language/stack (Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go, etc.)

### Key Technical Decisions
- Commands embed rules directly rather than loading external rule files
- Scripts handle structure, AI handles content and judgment
- Multi-agent architecture with Requirements Engineer as primary interface

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes
- [ ] 5 core commands fully operational (init, determine, design, define, do)
- [ ] <500 tokens per command execution
- [ ] 15+ supporting scripts for deterministic operations
- [ ] Successfully self-host own development using 4D+1 workflow

### Quality Standards
- **Code Coverage:** 80% for critical components
- **Performance:** Commands execute in <2 seconds
- **Documentation:** 100% of commands and templates documented
- **Safety:** Zero git accidents from framework operations

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **Context Window Limitations:** AI agents may hit token limits on complex projects
   - Likelihood: MEDIUM
   - Impact: HIGH
   - Mitigation: Efficient token usage, automatic compaction handling, state preservation

### Adoption Risks
1. **Learning Curve:** Users may find multi-agent architecture complex
   - Likelihood: MEDIUM
   - Impact: MEDIUM
   - Mitigation: Clear documentation, progressive disclosure, sensible defaults

## Stakeholders

### Core Team
- **Project Lead:** Bootstrap Development Team
  - Responsibilities: Framework architecture, command design, workflow patterns
- **Contributors:** Open source community
  - Responsibilities: Testing, feedback, domain adaptations

### Target Users
- **Primary:** Software developers using AI assistants
- **Secondary:** Project managers, researchers, policy makers exploring structured AI workflows

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy
Trunk-based development with feature branches for major changes

### Self-Hosting Requirement
All Bootstrap development must use Bootstrap's own commands:
- `/determine` for new features
- `/design` for architecture changes
- `/define` for implementation plans
- `/do` for execution

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Implementation complete using Bootstrap commands
- [ ] Scripts tested and POSIX-compliant
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Self-hosting validated (can Bootstrap build it?)

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)
- Core rule system
- Git safety controls
- Basic documentation

### Phase 2: 4D+1 Implementation (Current - Sep 2024)
- Five core commands
- Multi-agent architecture
- Supporting scripts

### Phase 3: Stabilization (Oct-Nov 2024)
- Self-hosting validation
- Documentation completion
- Community feedback integration

## Communication Plan

### Documentation Standards
- **Commands:** Comprehensive markdown in `.claude/commands/`
- **Templates:** Self-documenting with placeholders
- **Scripts:** Clear comments and error messages
- **Guides:** User-focused documentation in `.claude/docs/`

## Governance

### Decision Making
- **Technical Decisions:** ADRs document all significant choices
- **Feature Decisions:** Requirements → Design → Implementation workflow
- **Charter Changes:** Draft mode allows updates; future ratification possible

### Review Process
- **Charter Updates:** Open to modification while in draft status
- **Command Changes:** Must maintain backward compatibility
