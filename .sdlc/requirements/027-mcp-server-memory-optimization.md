# Requirements: MCP Server Memory Optimization (MVP)

**Feature ID:** 027-mcp-server-memory-optimization
**Date Created:** 2025-09-25
**Status:** Draft
**Priority:** P0 - Critical
**Type:** MVP Implementation

## Executive Summary

Implement minimal MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to bypass Claude Code's 16GB memory limitation by running the logic-design-expert agent in a separate process with 4GB memory allocation. This MVP solves the immediate problem of JavaScript heap exhaustion when running memory-intensive agents.

## Problem Statement

Claude Code's 16GB memory limit causes heap exhaustion when running more than 2 concurrent agents. The logic-design-expert agent alone consumes ~3.2GB, preventing it from running alongside other agents. This blocks critical semantic validation capabilities.

## MVP Scope

### In Scope (MVP)
- Single MCP server implementation for logic-design-expert
- Stdio transport only (simplest protocol)
- Fixed 4GB memory allocation
- Basic spawn/execute/cleanup lifecycle
- Integration with existing Task tool

### Out of Scope (Defer to v2)
- Multiple MCP servers
- Other agents conversions
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Performance monitoring
- Pool management
- Alternative transport protocols
- Graceful degradation
- Health checks

## User Scenarios (MVP Only)

### Scenario 1: Run Logic-Design-Expert Without Crashing
**As a** Bootstrap developer
**I want to** run logic-design-expert validation via MCP
**So that** it doesn't crash the main Claude Code process

**Acceptance**: Logic-design-expert completes without heap exhaustion

### Scenario 2: Automatic Cleanup
**As a** system user
**I want** MCP server processes to terminate after task completion
**So that** memory is freed immediately

**Acceptance**: No zombie processes after task completion

## Functional Requirements (MVP)

### Critical Only
- **FR-001**: Spawn Node.js MCP server with 4GB memory limit
- **FR-002**: Send prompt/context to MCP server via stdio
- **FR-003**: Receive response from MCP server
- **FR-004**: Terminate process after response received
- **FR-005**: Basic error handling (crash = return error to user)

## Non-Functional Requirements (MVP)

### Essential Performance
- **NFR-001**: MCP server starts in < 2 seconds
- **NFR-002**: Memory stays under 4GB limit
- **NFR-003**: Process terminates within 1 second of completion

### Essential Reliability
- **NFR-004**: No zombie processes
- **NFR-005**: Main process continues if MCP crashes

## Acceptance Criteria (MVP)

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Logic-design-expert runs as MCP server
- [ ] Memory usage stays under 4GB
- [ ] Process cleanup verified (no zombies)
- [ ] Can be called from Task tool
- [ ] Basic test proves it works

## Dependencies

### Required
- Node.js with stdio support
- File system access for server code
- Process spawn capability

### Assumptions
- System has 20GB+ RAM
- Claude Code keeps 16GB allocation
- ~10GB available for MCP servers

## Implementation Plan (MVP)

### Week 1: Build & Test
1. Create minimal MCP server for logic-design-expert
2. Implement stdio communication
3. Add 4GB memory configuration
4. Test spawn/execute/cleanup cycle
5. Integrate with Task tool
6. Verify memory isolation

### Directory Structure
```
.claude/mcp-servers/
└── logic-design-expert/
    ├── server.js      # MCP server implementation
    └── package.json   # Dependencies
```

### Configuration
```javascript
{
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["--max-old-space-size=4096", "server.js"],
  "transport": "stdio"
}
```

## Success Metrics (MVP)

### Must Achieve
- Logic-design-expert runs without crashing main process
- Memory freed immediately after task
- Zero zombie processes in testing

### Nice to Have (Track for v2)
- Execution time comparison
- Memory usage statistics
- Success rate percentage

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### Version 2.0
- Convert code-reviewer agent to MCP
- Add basic monitoring/logging
- Implement timeout handling
- Create troubleshooting guide

### Version 3.0
- Dynamic memory allocation
- MCP server pool for frequent operations
- Performance metrics dashboard
- Support for HTTP transport
- Graceful degradation to in-process
- Health check mechanisms

### Long-term Vision
- All memory-intensive agents as MCP servers
- Configurable memory limits per agent
- Automatic scaling based on system resources
- Integration with cloud environments

## Risk Mitigation (MVP)

### Primary Risk
**Risk**: MCP protocol complexity
**Mitigation**: Use simplest stdio mode, defer advanced features

### Secondary Risk
**Risk**: Process management bugs
**Mitigation**: Aggressive timeout (30s), force kill if needed

## Notes

This MVP focuses solely on proving MCP servers can solve our immediate memory problem. Once validated, we can incrementally add features based on actual usage patterns.

The implementation should take 3-5 days maximum. If it takes longer, we're over-engineering the MVP.
