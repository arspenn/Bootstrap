# ADR-001: Modular Analyzer Architecture

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The analyze command needs to support multiple types of analysis (rules, code, security, performance, etc.). We need to decide between a monolithic analyzer that handles everything or a modular approach where each analysis type is independent.

## Decision
We will use a modular architecture where each analysis type is a separate, independent module that can be composed together.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Easy to add new analysis types without modifying existing code
- Each analyzer can be tested independently
- Developers can run only the analyses they need
- Follows single responsibility principle
- Allows parallel execution of analyzers in future

### Negative
- Slightly more complex initial setup
- Need to define clear interfaces between components
- Potential for some code duplication across analyzers

### Neutral
- Each analyzer maintains its own configuration
- Report generation needs to aggregate results from multiple sources
- Need consistent severity definitions across analyzers
