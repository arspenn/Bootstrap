# ADR-001: Parallel Implementation for Quick-Feature Command

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to implement a streamlined /quick-feature command that works alongside the existing /gather-feature-requirements command. We have three potential approaches:
1. Minimal wrapper around gather-feature-requirements
2. Parallel implementation with independent logic
3. Modular service approach with shared components

Given uncertainty about how Claude Code handles modular commands and the need for rapid iteration, we need to choose an approach that balances maintainability with implementation speed.

## Decision
We will implement quick-feature as a parallel command with its own independent logic, sharing only templates and file formats with gather-feature-requirements.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Complete control over quick-feature behavior and optimizations
- Can iterate rapidly without affecting gather-feature-requirements
- Easier to implement quick-feature specific features
- No risk of breaking existing command
- Clear separation of concerns
- Can optimize conversation flow specifically for speed

### Negative
- Some code duplication between commands
- Risk of feature divergence over time
- Higher maintenance burden if core logic needs updates
- Need to maintain consistency manually

### Neutral
- Both commands will exist independently in .claude/commands/
- Templates will be shared via .claude/templates/
- Future refactoring to modular approach remains possible
- Testing needs to cover both commands separately

## Mitigation Strategies
- Document shared patterns clearly
- Add modular command refactoring to backlog for future consideration
- Keep command logic focused and simple to minimize duplication
- Use consistent naming and structure between commands
