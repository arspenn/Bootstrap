# ADR-007: Command Output Versioning

## Status
Proposed

## Context
As commands evolve, we need to know which version generated specific artifacts without:
- Updating all existing documents when commands change
- Creating version conflicts in git
- Adding complexity to the system

## Decision
Add a simple version footer to all command-generated artifacts:

```yaml
---
# Generated by: /determine v0.12.0
# Framework: Bootstrap v0.12.0
# Date: 2025-09-20
```

This footer is:
- Added at document creation only
- Never updated retroactively
- Provides audit trail of what generated each artifact
- Helps debug issues with older outputs

## Implementation
Each command includes in its template:
```markdown
[main content]

---
_Generated by: /{command} v{version} | Bootstrap v{framework_version} | {date}_
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear provenance for every generated document
- No retroactive updates needed
- Helps identify when to regenerate old artifacts
- Simple to implement
- Git-friendly (no spurious updates)

### Negative
- Slight increase in document size
- Another thing to maintain in templates

### Neutral
- Becomes historical record of project evolution
- Could enable migration tools in future
