# ADR-010: Section-by-Section Interaction Pattern

## Metadata

**Status:** ACCEPTED
**Date:** 2025-01-21
**Decision Makers:** Framework Architecture Team
**Related ADRs:** ADR-011 (Script vs AI Responsibilities)
**Supersedes:** None
**Superseded By:** None

## Summary

Commands will guide AI agents to fill documents section-by-section with user feedback after each section, rather than generating entire documents at once. This enables immediate course correction and progressive context building.

## Context and Problem Statement

When AI agents generate entire documents at once, users must read the whole document and provide comprehensive feedback, often missing issues or having to repeat corrections. The AI doesn't benefit from early feedback and may propagate errors throughout the document.

### Current State
AI agents typically generate complete documents in one pass, requiring extensive review and revision cycles.

### Requirements and Constraints
- Users need ability to guide document creation interactively
- AI needs to learn from corrections immediately
- Token efficiency must be maintained
- Workflow must remain conversational

### Assumptions
- Users prefer incremental review over batch review
- AI agents can maintain context across sections
- Early corrections improve later sections

## Decision Drivers

- **User Experience:** Easier to review and correct small sections
- **Quality:** Early corrections prevent propagated errors
- **Learning:** AI adapts within the same document
- **Efficiency:** Reduces total revision cycles

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Section-by-Section with Feedback
**Description:** Generate each section, get feedback, apply learning to next section
**Pros:**
- Immediate course correction
- Progressive quality improvement
- Natural conversation flow
- Easier user cognitive load

**Cons:**
- More interaction points
- Potentially slower initial generation
- Requires user availability

**Estimated Effort:** Medium
**Risk Level:** LOW

### Option 2: Complete Document Generation
**Description:** Generate entire document, then revise
**Pros:**
- Faster initial generation
- User can review at convenience
- Fewer interruptions

**Cons:**
- Errors propagate throughout
- Harder to track all issues
- Multiple revision cycles needed
- AI doesn't learn during generation

**Estimated Effort:** Low
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
**Description:** Generate major sections (3-4 at a time), then review
**Pros:**
- Balance between speed and feedback
- Some progressive learning
- Moderate user interaction

**Cons:**
- Still allows some error propagation
- Not as granular as section-by-section
- Compromise may not satisfy either need

**Estimated Effort:** Medium
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen Option
**Option 1: Section-by-Section with Feedback**

### Rationale
The section-by-section approach aligns with our philosophy of interactive, conversational AI assistance. While it requires more interaction points, it dramatically improves quality and reduces total time by eliminating revision cycles. Users report preferring this granular control.

### Implementation Approach
1. Scripts create document structure with empty sections
2. AI fills first section (e.g., Executive Summary)
3. User reviews and provides feedback
4. AI incorporates feedback and fills next section
5. Process repeats for each section
6. Final review of complete document

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- ✅ Higher quality documents on first pass
- ✅ AI learns user preferences during creation
- ✅ Users feel more in control
- ✅ Errors caught and fixed immediately
- ✅ Natural conversation flow maintained

### Negative Consequences
- ❌ Requires user to be present during generation
- ❌ Initial generation takes longer
- ❌ More interaction points to manage

### Neutral Consequences
- ➖ Changes typical document creation workflow
- ➖ Requires clear section boundaries in templates

### Technical Debt
- Need to ensure templates have clear section markers
- May need section-aware progress tracking

## Implementation Details

### Migration Strategy
Since this is a new pattern, no migration needed. Existing commands will adopt this pattern.

### Rollback Plan
If pattern proves problematic, can revert to full document generation with configuration flag.

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Reduction in revision cycles: Target 70% fewer
- [ ] User satisfaction with interaction: Target >8/10
- [ ] Document quality on first pass: Target 80% acceptance

## Validation and Review

### Validation Approach
Test with real document creation tasks, measure revision cycles and user satisfaction.

### Review Triggers
- User feedback indicates too many interruptions
- Quality metrics don't improve as expected
- 6-month scheduled review

## Notes and Considerations

This pattern is particularly important for complex documents like designs and requirements where early decisions affect later sections.
