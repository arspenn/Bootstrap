# ADR-001: Phased Migration Approach

## Status
Proposed

## Context
CLAUDE.md contains multiple rules in an informal format that need to be extracted into individual rule files. We need to decide between:
1. Migrating all rules at once
2. Phased migration with sequential testing
3. Automated transformation

The migration affects core project behavior and requires careful testing to avoid regressions.

## Decision
We will use a phased migration approach, extracting rules individually in a sequential manner with comprehensive testing between each extraction.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Lower Risk**: Each rule can be tested independently before proceeding
- **Easy Rollback**: Problems isolated to single rule migrations
- **Better Testing**: More thorough validation of each rule
- **Learning Opportunity**: Early migrations inform later ones
- **Incremental Value**: Benefits realized progressively

### Negative
- **Longer Timeline**: Sequential approach takes more time
- **Temporary Inconsistency**: Mixed formats during migration
- **More Commits**: Multiple changes instead of single update

### Neutral
- Migration happens over 2 days instead of hours
- Requires maintaining migration checklist
- Documentation updates happen incrementally
