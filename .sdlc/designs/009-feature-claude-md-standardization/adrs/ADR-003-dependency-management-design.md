# ADR-003: Rule Dependency Management Design

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Some rules depend on others (e.g., Python style rules need environment management). We need to decide how to handle dependencies:
1. No explicit dependencies (rely on import order)
2. Dependencies field in metadata
3. Hierarchical rule structure
4. Dependency injection system

Clear dependency management prevents rule loading errors and ensures correct initialization order.

## Decision
We will add a `dependencies` array field to rule metadata, listing rule IDs that must be loaded first. The system will perform topological sorting and circular dependency detection.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Explicit Relationships**: Clear which rules depend on others
- **Automatic Ordering**: System handles correct load sequence
- **Error Prevention**: Circular dependencies detected early
- **Modular Design**: Rules can be truly independent or dependent
- **Future Proof**: Supports complex rule interactions

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Dependency resolution adds processing
- **Potential Errors**: Missing dependencies cause failures
- **Testing Burden**: Need to test dependency chains

### Neutral
- Dependencies are optional (empty array by default)
- Circular dependencies result in load error
- Missing dependencies trigger warning but continue
