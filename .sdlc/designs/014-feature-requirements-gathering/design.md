# Requirements Gathering System Design Document

## Executive Summary

This design document outlines a phased implementation of an interactive requirements gathering system for the Bootstrap framework. The system will provide two primary commands: `/gather-feature-requirements` for detailed feature specifications and `/gather-project-requirements` for project-level planning. The implementation follows an incremental 5-week delivery schedule, starting with minimal viable functionality and progressively adding sophistication.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Based on the feature specification and clarifications:

1. **Interactive Requirements Elicitation**
   - Conversational flow using prompts to guide users
   - Support for both direct specification and problem-solution discovery
   - Progressive refinement through clarifying questions
   - Real-time ambiguity detection and feedback

2. **Output Generation**
   - Feature files compatible with `/design-feature` command
   - PLANNING.md generation and updates
   - Metadata tracking for basic traceability
   - Template-based consistent formatting

3. **Integration Points**
   - Seamless workflow with existing design-feature command
   - Feature files as direct input to design process
   - PLANNING.md updates for evolving project scope
   - Bootstrap framework conventions compliance

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Automatic ambiguity detection in responses
   - INVEST criteria validation for user stories
   - Completeness checking with suggestions
   - Reference-backed best practices

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Usability**
   - Simple conversational interface
   - Clear prompts and guidance
   - Immediate value in Week 1
   - No complex setup required

2. **Performance**
   - Quick generation of initial features
   - Incremental improvements without breaking changes
   - Token-efficient markdown output

3. **Maintainability**
   - Follows Bootstrap command template
   - Modular design for phased delivery
   - Clear separation between weeks' functionality

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Patterns
- Command structure in `.claude/commands/` with consistent template
- Feature files in `features/` directory with established format
- Design-to-PRP workflow already established
- Task management system for tracking implementation

### Integration Opportunities
- Leverage existing command template for consistency
- Use established feature file format as output target
- Connect to design-feature as next step in workflow
- Potential future integration with task management

## Proposed Design

### Overview

The system consists of two main commands implemented across 5 weeks:

1. **Week 1-2**: `/gather-feature-requirements` - Basic then enhanced feature gathering
2. **Week 3-4**: `/gather-project-requirements [file]` - Project scope definition and integration (optional file argument for updates or external docs)
3. **Week 5**: Quality validation and refinement across both commands

    User->>Command: /gather-feature-requirements
    Command->>ConversationEngine: Start conversation
    
    loop Interactive Gathering
        ConversationEngine->>User: Ask clarifying question
        User->>ConversationEngine: Provide response
        ConversationEngine->>AmbiguityDetector: Check response
        AmbiguityDetector-->>ConversationEngine: Feedback if ambiguous
    end
    
    ConversationEngine->>TemplateProcessor: Process gathered data
    TemplateProcessor->>FileSystem: Generate feature file
    FileSystem-->>User: Feature file created
    User->>Command: /design-feature [generated-file]
```

### Implementation Phases

#### Week 1: Basic Feature Requirements
- Optional initial context via argument
- Minimal conversation flow (role, feature, benefit, criteria)
- Simple template output
- Basic user story format
- Context extraction from provided input
- No validation beyond structure

#### Week 2: Enhanced Feature Requirements  
- Multiple stakeholder perspectives
- Boundary questions
- Dependency detection
- Pattern-based ambiguity detection with suggestions (per ADR-003)
- INVEST criteria checking

#### Week 3: Basic Project Requirements
- Core questions (What, Who, Why)
- Simple PLANNING.md generation
- 5 essential sections
- Support for updates to existing PLANNING.md (via file argument)
- Support for external document input (reports, specs)

#### Week 4: Integration
- Link features to project goals
- Bidirectional references
- Context awareness between commands

#### Week 5: Quality Gates
- Completeness validation
- Review triggers
- Issue summaries
- Best practice references

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Alternative 1: Template-First Approach
**Description**: Provide templates that users fill in manually with minimal interaction

**Pros**:
- Simpler implementation
- Faster initial delivery
- Lower complexity

**Cons**:
- Less value over existing templates
- No intelligent guidance
- Higher user effort

**Decision**: Rejected - doesn't provide sufficient value over current state

### Alternative 2: Full NLP Analysis
**Description**: Natural language processing to extract requirements from freeform text

**Pros**:
- More flexible input
- Potentially faster for users
- Advanced capability

**Cons**:
- Complex implementation
- Higher error rate
- Difficult to validate
- May require external dependencies

**Decision**: Rejected - too complex for incremental approach

### Alternative 3: Hybrid Interactive (Chosen)
**Description**: Guided conversation with structured prompts and validation (as per ADR-001)

**Pros**:
- Clear value proposition
- Incremental complexity
- Predictable results
- Builds on existing patterns
- No external dependencies

**Cons**:
- Requires careful prompt design
- May feel restrictive to some users
- May require multiple rounds for complete information

**Decision**: Selected - best balance of value and implementation feasibility, follows ADR-001

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks

1. **Conversation Complexity**
   - Risk: Branching logic becomes unwieldy
   - Mitigation: Start linear, add branches incrementally
   - Monitoring: Track conversation completion rates

2. **Ambiguity Detection Accuracy**
   - Risk: Too many false positives frustrate users
   - Mitigation: Conservative detection, user can override
   - Monitoring: Track acceptance of suggestions

3. **Template Rigidity**
   - Risk: Output too constrained for some projects
   - Mitigation: Allow template customization in future phase
   - Monitoring: Gather feedback on template suitability

### Project Risks

1. **Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Features become too complex for timeline
   - Mitigation: Strict weekly boundaries, defer to Phase 2 (per ADR-002)
   - Monitoring: Weekly checkpoint reviews

2. **Integration Challenges**
   - Risk: Doesn't integrate smoothly with design-feature
   - Mitigation: Test integration early and often
   - Monitoring: End-to-end workflow testing

3. **Incremental Delivery Risks**
   - Risk: Refactoring needed in later weeks
   - Mitigation: Accept temporary limitations (per ADR-002)
   - Monitoring: Track technical debt for Phase 2

## Success Criteria

### Week 1
