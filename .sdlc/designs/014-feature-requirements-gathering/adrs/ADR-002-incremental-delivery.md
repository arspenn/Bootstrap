# ADR-002: Incremental Delivery Strategy

## Status
Proposed

## Context

The requirements gathering system is complex enough that attempting to deliver all functionality at once poses significant risk. The feature specification outlines a 5-week phased approach, but we need to decide how strictly to follow this incremental strategy.

Considerations:
- Bootstrap needs immediate value to continue its own development
- Complex features often fail when built all at once
- Each week's work should be independently valuable
- Later weeks might reveal needs to refactor earlier work
- Testing and validation need to happen throughout

## Decision

We will follow a **strict incremental delivery model** with hard boundaries between weekly phases:

1. Week 1 delivers a complete, working (if basic) feature command
2. Each subsequent week enhances but doesn't break previous functionality
3. No forward-looking code in early weeks (avoid pre-optimization)
4. Each week's delivery is tested by using it for the next week's development
5. Defer any "nice to have" features to Phase 2 ruthlessly

This means accepting temporary limitations in early weeks rather than trying to build the perfect system immediately.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Delivers value immediately (Week 1 feature can be used right away)
- Reduces risk of project failure or abandonment
- Provides real usage feedback to guide later weeks
- Forces focus on core functionality first
- Creates natural testing through self-use

### Negative
- May require some refactoring in later weeks
- Early versions will have obvious limitations
- Users might be frustrated by missing features initially
- Some inefficiency from not planning everything upfront

### Neutral
- Creates a series of milestones rather than one big delivery
- Requires discipline to resist scope creep
- Documentation needs updates each week
- Success depends on accurate weekly scoping
