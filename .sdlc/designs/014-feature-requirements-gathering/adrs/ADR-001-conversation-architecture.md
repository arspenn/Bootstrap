# ADR-001: Interactive Conversation Architecture

## Status
Proposed

## Context

The requirements gathering system needs to collect information from users through some form of interaction. The feature specification calls for a conversational approach similar to the design-feature command process, where Claude guides users through a series of questions to elicit requirements.

Key considerations:
- Users may not know exactly what they want initially
- Requirements often emerge through discussion and clarification
- The system must work within Claude's conversational paradigm
- Output must be structured despite unstructured input
- The approach must be simple enough for Week 1 implementation

## Decision

We will implement a **guided interactive conversation** approach using structured prompts with conditional branching based on user responses.

The conversation will:
1. Accept optional initial context to seed the conversation
2. Start with open-ended questions if no context provided
3. Use progressive refinement through follow-up questions
4. Extract available information from provided context
5. Maintain conversation state to build complete requirements
6. Allow users to provide either specifications or problems to solve

This approach mirrors the successful design-feature command pattern already in Bootstrap.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Familiar pattern for Bootstrap users (matches design-feature flow)
- Helps users who don't know exactly what they want
- Produces consistent, well-structured output
- Can start simple and add sophistication incrementally
- No external dependencies or complex NLP required

### Negative
- May feel slow for users who know exactly what they want
- Requires careful prompt engineering to be effective
- Conversation state management adds complexity
- May need multiple rounds to get all information

### Neutral
- Creates a different experience from traditional requirements documents
- Shifts work from user (writing) to system (asking questions)
- Requires ongoing refinement based on usage patterns
