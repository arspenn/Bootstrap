name: Initial CHANGELOG.md Creation
description: |
  Create the initial CHANGELOG.md file documenting Bootstrap's development history from inception to current state.
  
  This PRP follows Keep a Changelog standard and establishes the foundation for ongoing changelog management.
  
  Core objectives:
  - Document all significant changes from project start
  - Group changes by version according to roadmap
  - Follow Keep a Changelog format exactly
  - Include links to commits where relevant
  - Set up "Unreleased" section for ongoing work

## Goal

Create a comprehensive CHANGELOG.md that:
1. Documents project history from initial commit to present
2. Groups changes into logical versions (0.1.0, 0.2.0)
3. Follows Keep a Changelog standard
4. Provides clear, concise descriptions of changes
5. Sets foundation for future updates

## Why

**User Value**: Users can understand project evolution and find specific changes
**Developer Value**: Clear history for debugging and feature tracking
**Project Maturity**: Professional projects maintain changelogs
**Onboarding**: New contributors understand project progression

## What

### Success Criteria
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md created following Keep a Changelog format

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2025-07-12
### Added
- Feature description

### Changed

## Implementation Blueprint

### Step 1: Create CHANGELOG.md Structure
```markdown
# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2025-07-12

## [0.2.0] - 2025-07-12

## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-11
```

### Step 2: Document Version 0.1.0
Initial bootstrap template creation:
- Added: Basic project structure
- Added: Design-first workflow commands
- Added: PRP generation and execution
- Added: CLAUDE.md for AI conventions
- Added: Template system for features

### Step 3: Document Version 0.2.0
Git control rules system:
- Added: Comprehensive Git control rules (add, commit, push, pull, branch)
- Added: User preferences system for rule management
- Added: Rule documentation structure
- Added: Commit message templates
- Added: ADRs for design decisions
- Changed: Project scope to comprehensive AI framework
- Fixed: Security model to allow user overrides

### Step 4: Document Version 0.3.0

- Added: @import mechanism for efficient rule loading
- Added: MASTER_IMPORTS.md for centralized imports
- Added: Separation of rules and documentation
- Changed: Rule files to instructions-only format
- Changed: Token usage reduced by 83.6%
- Added: Comprehensive benchmarks

### Step 5: Document Unreleased
Current work in progress:
- Added: ROADMAP.md for project vision
- Added: CREDITS.md for attributions
- Added: ADR-006 for framework pivot
- Changed: README.md to reflect comprehensive framework
- Added: Git merge control rules (in progress)
- Added: Changelog management system (in progress)

### Step 6: Add Links
Add commit hashes for major changes:
```markdown
### Added
- Comprehensive Git control rules ([c9d297b](../../commit/c9d297b))
```

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Format Validation
```bash
# Check markdown syntax
markdownlint CHANGELOG.md || echo "Install markdownlint-cli for validation"

# Check Keep a Changelog format
grep -E "## \[Unreleased\]|## \[[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\]" CHANGELOG.md

# Verify sections
grep -E "### Added|### Changed|### Fixed|### Removed" CHANGELOG.md
```

### Level 2: Content Validation
```bash
# Verify all versions mentioned
grep -E "\[0.1.0\]|\[0.2.0\]|\[0.3.0\]" CHANGELOG.md

# Check date format
grep -E "[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}" CHANGELOG.md

# Verify link format
grep -E "\[[a-f0-9]{7}\]" CHANGELOG.md || echo "No commit links found"
```

### Level 3: Completeness Check
Manual review:
- All major features documented?
- Descriptions clear and concise?
- Categories appropriate?
- Version progression logical?
- Unreleased section current?

## Final Validation Checklist

- [ ] CHANGELOG.md created in project root
- [ ] Keep a Changelog format followed exactly
- [ ] All versions documented (0.1.0, 0.2.0, 0.3.0)
- [ ] Unreleased section includes current work
- [ ] Each version has appropriate categories
- [ ] Descriptions are user-focused, not technical
- [ ] Links to commits work correctly
- [ ] File is readable and well-organized

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Don't include every commit** - Only notable changes
2. **Don't use technical jargon** - Write for users
3. **Don't forget the Unreleased section** - Critical for ongoing work
4. **Don't mix categories** - Keep Added, Changed, Fixed separate
5. **Don't skip versions** - Document the progression
