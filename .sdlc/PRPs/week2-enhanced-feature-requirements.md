name: "Week 2: Enhanced Feature Requirements Gathering"
description: |

## Purpose
Enhance the existing `/gather-feature-requirements` command with sophisticated validation, multi-stakeholder perspectives, boundary questions, dependency detection, and ambiguity resolution. This builds upon Week 1's foundation to create a more robust requirements elicitation system that helps users create higher quality, clearer requirements.

## Core Principles
1. **Preserve Week 1 Functionality**: All enhancements must be additive, not breaking
2. **Hybrid AI Detection**: Combine known patterns with Claude's NLP for intelligent analysis
3. **User-Friendly Feedback**: Suggestions, not mandates; users can override
4. **Incremental Complexity**: Add sophistication without overwhelming users
5. **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on catching high-impact issues
6. **Leverage AI Capabilities**: Use Claude's understanding for context-aware validation

---

## Goal
Enhance `/gather-feature-requirements` to detect and resolve ambiguity, validate against INVEST criteria, gather multiple stakeholder perspectives, identify boundaries and dependencies, resulting in more complete and actionable feature specifications.

## Why
- Week 1 implementation captures basic requirements but lacks quality checks
- Ambiguous requirements lead to implementation problems downstream
- Multiple stakeholder perspectives reveal hidden requirements
- Boundary questions prevent scope creep
- INVEST validation ensures stories are implementation-ready
- Dependency detection helps with planning and sequencing

## What
Enhancements to the command that:
- Detect ambiguous terms and suggest specific alternatives
- Validate user stories against INVEST criteria
- Ask boundary questions to define scope limits
- Identify dependencies on other features/systems
- Improve conversation branching for better flow
- Enhance output quality with richer metadata

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Ambiguity detection catches common vague terms
- [ ] INVEST validation identifies and helps fix issues
- [ ] Boundary questions clarify scope and constraints
- [ ] Dependencies documented in feature file
- [ ] Existing Week 1 functionality still works
- [ ] Users can override all suggestions

## Implementation Blueprint

### Task 1: Add Hybrid Ambiguity Detection

CREATE ambiguity detection in gather-feature-requirements.md:
```markdown
### Ambiguity Detection (Hybrid Approach)

Use Claude's natural language understanding to analyze responses for ambiguity, supplemented by known patterns:

**Known Pattern Examples** (starting points for Claude):
- **Performance**: fast, slow, quick, responsive, efficient
- **Size/Quantity**: some, many, few, several, lots  
- **Quality**: good, better, nice, user-friendly, intuitive
- **Time**: soon, eventually, later, quickly, ASAP
- **Reliability**: reliable, robust, stable, secure

**Claude's Analysis Instructions**:
"Analyze the user's response for ambiguous or vague terms that could cause implementation confusion. Consider:
1. Unmeasurable qualities (fast, user-friendly, intuitive)
2. Vague quantities (some, many, a lot)
3. Imprecise timeframes (soon, eventually)
4. Subjective assessments (good, better, nice)
5. Context-specific ambiguity based on the feature domain

For each ambiguous element found, suggest a more specific alternative that maintains the user's intent."

**Example Response**:
"I notice some ambiguity in your requirements:
- 'fast response time' → Could you specify? (e.g., 'responds within 2 seconds')
- 'many users' → What scale are we targeting? (e.g., '100-1000 concurrent users')

Would you like to clarify these points? (yes/no/skip)"
```

### Task 2: Implement AI-Enhanced INVEST Validation

ADD to gather-feature-requirements.md:
```markdown
### INVEST Validation (AI-Enhanced)

After gathering user story, use Claude's understanding to evaluate INVEST criteria:

**Validation Prompt for Claude**:
"Evaluate this user story against INVEST criteria:
Story: {gathered_story}
Acceptance Criteria: {gathered_criteria}

Check for:
- Independent: Can this be developed without waiting for other features?
- Negotiable: Is the problem stated rather than a specific solution?
- Valuable: Is there clear business/user value in the 'so that' clause?
- Estimatable: Is there enough detail to estimate effort?
- Small: Could this fit in a single sprint/iteration?
- Testable: Are the acceptance criteria verifiable?

Provide specific feedback for any criteria that need improvement."

**Claude's Contextual Analysis**:
- Understand domain context to assess real dependencies
- Recognize when technical solutions are over-specified vs necessary
- Evaluate value propositions based on stated user needs
- Assess size based on complexity patterns in similar features
- Identify missing testability in acceptance criteria

**Example Feedback**:
"INVEST Analysis:
✓ Independent - Can be developed standalone
⚠ Negotiable - Specifies 'must use OAuth' - is this a requirement or preference?
✓ Valuable - Clear benefit to users
⚠ Estimatable - Need more detail on 'multiple report types'
✓ Small - Reasonable scope for one iteration
✓ Testable - Acceptance criteria are verifiable

Would you like to address the flagged items? (yes/no)"
```

### Task 3: Implement AI-Driven Boundary Questions

ADD boundary exploration:
```markdown
### Boundary and Scope Questions (AI-Driven)

After acceptance criteria, use Claude to identify relevant boundary questions:

**Claude's Boundary Analysis**:
"Based on the feature: {feature_description}

Generate relevant boundary questions considering:
1. The specific domain and context
2. Common edge cases for this type of feature
3. Likely integration points
4. Potential scalability concerns
5. Security and compliance considerations relevant to the feature

Ask 3-5 most important boundary questions specific to this feature."

**Example for a payment feature**:
"Let's clarify the boundaries:
1. What payment methods are in scope? (credit card, PayPal, crypto?)
2. What's the maximum transaction amount to support?
3. How should the system handle failed payments?
4. Are there specific compliance requirements (PCI-DSS, regional regulations)?
5. Should this integrate with existing accounting systems?"

**Example for a search feature**:
"Let's define the scope:
1. What content types should be searchable?
2. How many results should be returned maximum?
3. Should search work across archived/deleted content?
4. Do we need fuzzy matching or exact match only?
5. Are there performance requirements for search speed?"

Add contextual boundaries to output based on responses.
```

### Task 4: Add AI-Powered Dependency Detection

IMPLEMENT dependency identification:
```markdown
### Dependency Detection (AI-Powered)

Use Claude to identify both explicit and implicit dependencies:

**Claude's Dependency Analysis**:
"Analyze the feature for dependencies:
Feature: {feature_description}
Context: {any_mentioned_systems_or_features}

Identify:
1. Explicit dependencies mentioned by the user
2. Implicit dependencies based on the feature type
3. Common infrastructure dependencies (auth, database, APIs)
4. Potential downstream features that might depend on this
5. Integration points with existing systems

Distinguish between hard dependencies (must have) and soft dependencies (nice to have)."

**Example Analysis**:
"I've identified these potential dependencies:

**Hard Dependencies** (required before this feature):
- User authentication system (for user-specific features)
- Database schema for storing {data_type}

**Soft Dependencies** (would enhance but not required):
- Notification system (could alert users but not essential)
- Analytics service (useful but feature works without it)

**This feature would enable**:
- Advanced reporting features
- API endpoints for mobile apps

Are these dependencies correct? Any others to add?"

Add confirmed dependencies to output with context about why they're needed.
```

### Task 5: Enhance AI-Adaptive Conversation

UPDATE conversation logic:
```markdown
### AI-Adaptive Conversation Flow

Let Claude adapt the conversation based on context and user responses:

**Claude's Conversation Adaptation**:
"Based on the user's responses so far, adapt your questioning approach:

1. Assess user's technical level from their language
2. Identify areas needing more detail based on feature complexity
3. Recognize when to dig deeper vs when to move on
4. Detect frustration or confusion and adjust accordingly
5. Provide examples relevant to their domain

Maintain a helpful, non-patronizing tone regardless of technical level."

**Dynamic Branching Examples**:

For technical users mentioning APIs:
"I see you're thinking about API design. Should we define the endpoint structure and data contracts now?"

For business users focused on outcomes:
"That's a valuable outcome. What metrics would tell us we've succeeded?"

For complex features:
"This sounds comprehensive. Would you like to start with an MVP version and iterate?"

For unclear requirements:
"Let me make sure I understand - you want {interpretation}. Is that right?"

Claude uses context to ask the most relevant follow-up questions rather than following a rigid script.
```

### Task 6: Improve Output Quality

ENHANCE feature file generation:
```markdown
### Enhanced Output Structure

# Feature: {Title}

**Date**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Priority**: {High|Medium|Low}
**Status**: Requirements Gathered
**INVEST Score**: {I:✓ N:✓ V:✓ E:✓ S:✓ T:✓}

```

## Implementation Patterns

### Hybrid AI Analysis Approach
```markdown
# Combine pattern recognition with Claude's NLP

## Pattern Library (Starting Points)
Known ambiguous terms serve as examples for Claude:
- Performance: fast, slow, responsive
- Quantity: some, many, few
- Quality: good, better, user-friendly
- Time: soon, later, ASAP
- Reliability: reliable, robust, stable

## Claude's Contextual Analysis
Rather than rigid pattern matching, Claude:
1. Understands context to identify domain-specific ambiguity
2. Recognizes implied dependencies not explicitly stated
3. Evaluates story completeness based on feature type
4. Adapts suggestions to user's technical level
5. Provides examples relevant to the specific domain

## Example Prompt Structure
"Analyze this requirement for clarity and completeness:
'{user_requirement}'

Consider:
- Domain context (e.g., e-commerce, healthcare, fintech)
- Technical vs business user language
- Implicit assumptions that need clarification
- Missing acceptance criteria for this type of feature

Provide specific, actionable suggestions."
```

### AI-Enhanced Validation Flow
```markdown
# Let Claude handle complex validation logic

## INVEST Analysis Prompt
"Evaluate against INVEST criteria considering:
- The specific domain and feature type
- Common patterns in similar features
- Realistic scope for the team's context
- Technical dependencies that may not be obvious

Don't just check for keywords - understand the actual dependencies and constraints."

## Boundary Question Generation
"Generate boundary questions specific to a {feature_type} feature in {domain}:
- Consider common edge cases for this feature type
- Include relevant compliance/security considerations
- Ask about integration points typical for this domain
- Focus on the 3-5 most critical boundaries to define"

## Dependency Discovery
"Identify dependencies for this feature:
- Look beyond explicit mentions
- Consider infrastructure requirements
- Identify common integrations for this feature type
- Distinguish must-have vs nice-to-have dependencies"
```

### Adaptive Conversation Management
```markdown
# Claude manages conversation flow dynamically

## Conversation State Tracking
Claude maintains context throughout the conversation:
- What's been gathered so far
- User's technical level and domain
- Areas needing more detail
- Signs of confusion or frustration

## Dynamic Question Selection
Instead of fixed question trees, Claude:
1. Asks most relevant question based on current context
2. Skips questions already answered implicitly
3. Provides domain-specific examples
4. Adjusts complexity based on user responses

## Natural Flow Example
User: "We need a dashboard"
Claude: "What key metrics should this dashboard display?"
(Rather than generic "Who is the user?")

User: "Sales data for managers"
Claude: "Should managers see their team's data only, or company-wide?"
(Contextual follow-up based on role mentioned)
```

## Validation Loop

### Validation Steps for Implementation
```bash
# 1. Test enhanced ambiguity detection
/gather-feature-requirements "I want a fast system for users"
# Should detect 'fast' and 'users' as ambiguous

# 2. Test INVEST validation
/gather-feature-requirements "As a developer, I want a better UI"
# Should flag issues with V (value not clear) and E (not estimatable)

# 3. Test stakeholder perspectives
/gather-feature-requirements
# When asked about other stakeholders, provide "administrators, support staff"
# Should gather perspectives for each

# 4. Test boundary questions
/gather-feature-requirements "I need a reporting system"
# Should ask about scope limits, constraints, edge cases

# 5. Test dependency detection
/gather-feature-requirements "After login is built, I want dashboard features"
# Should detect dependency on login

# 6. Test enhanced output
cat features/[generated-file].md
# Should include INVEST score, ambiguity level, stakeholder views, dependencies

# 7. Test backward compatibility
/gather-feature-requirements "As a user, I want to login, so that I can access my account"
# Should still work with Week 1 basic flow

# 8. Integration test
/design-feature features/[enhanced-file].md
# Enhanced file should work seamlessly with design-feature
```

## Final Validation Checklist
- [ ] Ambiguity detection identifies vague terms with helpful suggestions
- [ ] INVEST validation catches story quality issues
- [ ] Boundary questions clarify scope and constraints
- [ ] Dependencies are identified and documented
- [ ] Week 1 functionality remains intact
- [ ] Enhanced output provides richer metadata
- [ ] Users can override any automated suggestions
- [ ] Conversation flow adapts to user responses
- [ ] Integration with design-feature preserved

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid (Week 2 Specific)
- ❌ Don't make validation too strict (users should be able to override)
- ❌ Don't implement complex NLP (keep it pattern-based per ADR-003)
- ❌ Don't break Week 1 functionality (all enhancements are additive)
- ❌ Don't add external dependencies (everything self-contained)
- ❌ Don't over-complicate the conversation (maintain simplicity)
- ❌ Don't force users through all enhancements (make them optional)

## Backlog for Future Weeks

### Multiple Stakeholder Perspectives (Deferred)
Originally planned for Week 2 but moved to backlog as too advanced:
- Gather perspectives from multiple stakeholder types (administrators, support, etc.)
- Capture how different roles interact with the feature
- Document value proposition for each stakeholder
- Add stakeholder-specific acceptance criteria

This feature requires more sophisticated conversation branching and may overwhelm users in Week 2. Consider for Week 3 or later when base functionality is stable.

## Success Metrics
- Ambiguity detection catches 80% of common vague terms
- INVEST validation identifies at least one issue in 60% of stories
- Boundary questions prevent scope creep in tested scenarios
- Dependencies correctly identified in 70% of features
- No regression in Week 1 functionality
- User satisfaction with suggestions (can track override rates)

**Confidence Score: 9/10**

This PRP leverages Claude's natural language processing capabilities to create a more intelligent and adaptive requirements gathering system. By combining known patterns as starting points with Claude's contextual understanding, we achieve:

1. **Smarter Ambiguity Detection**: Claude understands context-specific ambiguity beyond simple pattern matching
2. **Intelligent INVEST Validation**: Evaluates stories based on actual meaning, not just keywords
3. **Adaptive Conversation Flow**: Claude adjusts questioning based on user responses and domain
4. **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Provides examples and suggestions relevant to the specific feature domain
5. **Natural Interaction**: Conversations feel less scripted and more helpful

The hybrid approach reduces implementation complexity while increasing effectiveness. Instead of trying to anticipate every pattern, we provide Claude with guidelines and let it use its understanding to identify issues and provide relevant suggestions.

The high confidence score reflects the improved approach that leverages AI capabilities rather than fighting against them. The only uncertainty is ensuring the prompts guide Claude effectively, but these can be refined based on testing.
