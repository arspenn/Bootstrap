## User Story

As a developer using the Bootstrap framework
I want to clean up all Bootstrap development history
So that I have a clean, usable framework ready for my new project

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Complete Development History Removal
- **Given** a cloned Bootstrap framework with full development history
- **When** I run the cleanup command
- **Then** all SDLC artifacts (.sdlc/ directory) are removed AND all development-specific files (TASK.md, CHANGELOG.md, ROADMAP.md, CREDITS.md, responses/) are deleted

### Scenario 2: Git Repository Reset
- **Given** the Bootstrap framework with existing git history
- **When** the cleanup command executes
- **Then** the .git directory is completely removed, allowing initialization of a new repository

### Scenario 3: Configuration Reset to Defaults
- **Given** the Bootstrap framework with customized configurations
- **When** cleanup is performed
- **Then** .claude/config.yaml is reset to default values suitable for a new project

### Scenario 4: Framework Integrity Preserved
- **Given** the core framework structure
- **When** cleanup completes
- **Then** all .claude/ functionality remains intact AND CLAUDE.md is preserved AND AI_TRANSPARENCY.md is kept AND Claude can operate normally

### Scenario 5: Already-Clean Project Handling
- **Given** a project that has already been cleaned
- **When** the cleanup command is run again
- **Then** the command scans the repository AND reports "Project verified as ready to develop" AND provides a summary of the clean state

### Scenario 6: Example Code Detection
- **Given** code files exist outside the framework directories
- **When** the reset command finds potential example code
- **Then** Claude asks the user "Found {file} - is this an example for your current project? (keep/remove)"

## Boundaries and Constraints

### Out of Scope
- Creating new project scaffolding
- Initializing new git repository
- Setting up project-specific configurations
- Creating new README or documentation
- Any "new project setup" tasks beyond cleanup

### In Scope
- Removing all Bootstrap development artifacts
- Clearing git history completely
- Resetting configurations to defaults
- Verifying framework functionality preservation
- Providing cleanup summary

### System Limits
- Command must complete within reasonable time (< 30 seconds)
- Must handle file permission errors gracefully
- Should work on all platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows)

### Edge Cases
- Running on already-cleaned project (scan and verify)
- Missing directories/files (skip gracefully)
- Permission denied errors (report but continue)
- Partially cleaned state (complete the cleanup)

## Dependencies

### Requires (Upstream)
- Bootstrap framework structure (.claude/ directory)
- File system access permissions
- Git command availability (for .git removal)

### Required By (Downstream)
- Alpha testing phase
- New project initialization workflows
- Framework distribution/release

### Integration Points
- File system operations
- Git repository management
- Configuration file manipulation

## Additional Context

This is the final step before alpha testing. The command should be intelligent enough to:
- Identify Bootstrap development artifacts even if structure changes
- Use Claude's judgment for items not explicitly specified
- Offer suggestions or ask for clarification when encountering ambiguous items
- Always scan thoroughly regardless of apparent state

Files/directories to remove:
- .sdlc/ (entire directory with all SDLC artifacts)
- TASK.md
- CHANGELOG.md  
- ROADMAP.md
- CREDITS.md
- PLANNING.md
- README.md
- responses/ directory
- .git/ directory

Files to preserve:
- AI_TRANSPARENCY.md
- CLAUDE.md
- LICENSE (user needs to update name but keep same license)
- requirements.txt
- All .claude/ framework files

## Technical Considerations

- Command name: `/reset-framework` (not /cleanup-project)
- No backup creation (GitHub repository serves as backup)
- Direct deletion of files without confirmation prompts
- Must handle both Unix and Windows path separators
- Should use git-safe operations where applicable
- Provide clear summary of actions taken
- Report verification status if already clean
- .gitignore remains unchanged (as-is)
- If example code found outside framework files, ask user if they should be kept for current project

## Open Questions

None - all requirements clarified
