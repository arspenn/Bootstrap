## FEATURE:

- A comprehensive but lightweight task tracking system for Bootstrap agents
- Easily and effectively integrates with third party task software
- Integrates with rules for consistent use
- Simple functionally designed for incremental improvement
- Design to integrate with Github Projects

## EXAMPLES:
