## User Story

As a developer
I want comprehensive documentation for the SDLC directory structure rule
So that I understand how the rule enforces the new directory structure

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Documentation Creation
- **Given** the sdlc-directory-structure rule exists
- **When** I create documentation for it
- **Then** it should explain the rule's purpose, behavior, and integration

### Scenario 2: Documentation Coverage
- **Given** the documentation is created
- **When** I review it
- **Then** it should cover enforcement rules, examples, troubleshooting, and best practices

## Boundaries and Constraints

### Out of Scope
- Modifying the rule implementation
- Creating additional rules
- Updating other documentation

### In Scope
- Creating comprehensive rule documentation
- Explaining enforcement behavior
- Providing usage examples
- Troubleshooting guidance

## Dependencies

### Requires (Upstream)
- sdlc-directory-structure rule implementation
- SDLC consolidation migration completed

### Required By (Downstream)

- Troubleshooting SDLC file operations

### Integration Points

- Other project rules

## Additional Context

Documentation created immediately after SDLC consolidation migration to ensure the new rule is well-documented for developers who need to understand or troubleshoot the enforced directory structure.

## Technical Considerations

- Documentation follows standard rule documentation format
- Includes practical examples and error messages
- Covers integration with other rules
- Provides VS Code configuration tips

## Open Questions

None - documentation completed.
