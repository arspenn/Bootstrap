# FEATURE: Design Addendum System

## CONTEXT

Currently, when designs need updates or corrections after approval, we're using temporary addendum files (e.g., `design-addendum-001.md`). This is a workaround that requires formalization.

## FEATURE

- Create a standardized addendum system for design documents
- Define when to use addendums vs. updating the original design
- Implement inheritance/extension mechanism for design properties
- Support versioning and tracking of design evolution
- Enable automatic integration of addendums into main designs
- Ensure Claude Code can recognize and properly handle addendums

## EXAMPLES

1. **Minor corrections**: Typos, clarifications → Update original
2. **Implementation discoveries**: New requirements found during coding → Addendum
3. **Scope additions**: Features that extend but don't change core → Addendum
4. **Major changes**: Fundamental redesign → New design version

### Proposed Structure:
```
005-feature-standardize-designs/
├── design.md                    # Original design
├── addendums/                   # Addendum folder
│   ├── 001-diagram-migration.md # First addendum
│   └── 002-rule-updates.md      # Second addendum
└── design.v2.md                 # Major revision (if needed)
```

### Proposed Addendum Frontmatter:
```yaml
---
type: addendum
parent_design: design.md
addendum_number: 001
reason: implementation-gap|scope-addition|clarification
integration_status: pending|integrated
---
```

## DOCUMENTATION

- Similar systems: Git commits vs. Git patches
- Design patterns: Decorator pattern, Extension pattern
- Related: Version control best practices

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

- Should addendums be automatically applied or require explicit integration?
- How to handle conflicts between multiple addendums?
- Should we support addendum dependencies/ordering?
- Consider tooling to merge addendums into designs
- Define clear criteria for when integration should happen
