## FEATURE: Enhanced TASK.md Structure (Phase 1)

- Implement structured markdown format for TASK.md with metadata comments
- Add priority levels (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) for task organization
- Include task IDs, estimates, and assignee metadata in HTML comments
- Create active sprint section with date ranges
- Add discovered tasks tracking for items found during implementation
- Fully migrate and reorganize existing TASK.md content
- Clean up and properly categorize all existing tasks
- Create task management commands for Claude

*Note: Do not take any decicions in this feature request as set in stone. Continue to suggest alternatives if relevant*

## EXAMPLES:

- `features/enhanced-task-management-feature.md` - Lines 28-56 show target structure
- [Claude Task Master](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master) - Similar markdown-based approach
- [GitHub Task Lists](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents/) - Compatible format

## DOCUMENTATION:

- [Markdown Task Lists]: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists
- [HTML Comments in Markdown]: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#html
- Internal: Current TASK.md structure requiring cleanup

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- **Token Efficiency**: Maintain markdown's 15% token advantage over JSON
- **Task Audit**: Review all existing tasks for relevance and completion status
- **Reorganization**: Properly categorize misplaced or orphaned tasks
- **Git History**: Preserve history when updating TASK.md structure
- **Validation**: Add rules to check task consistency
- **Discovery**: Track tasks discovered during implementation
- CRITICAL: All existing tasks must be evaluated and properly placed in new structure

## CONTEXT:

The current TASK.md has accumulated various tasks over time, some manually added without proper organization, others potentially completed but not marked as such. This migration is an opportunity to audit all tasks, remove duplicates, verify completion status, and organize everything into the new structured format. Phase 1 focuses on establishing the enhanced structure and cleaning up the existing task inventory.

## SUCCESS METRICS:

- All existing tasks audited and verified
- Completed tasks properly marked and moved to Completed section
- Duplicate or obsolete tasks removed
- All active tasks have priority, ID, and estimate metadata
- Tasks organized into Active Sprint, Backlog, and Completed sections
- Task management commands created in `.claude/commands/`
- Documentation updated with new structure

## OUT OF SCOPE:

- External tool integration (Phase 3)
- Automatic TODO detection from codebase (Phase 2)
- Task generation from features (Phase 2)
- GitHub Issues synchronization (Phase 3)
- Web UI or mobile app
- Complex project management features

## PROPOSED STRUCTURE:

```markdown
# Task Management

## Active Sprint
<!-- sprint: 2025-01-15 to 2025-01-29 -->

### [HIGH] Feature: Enhanced Task System
<!-- id: TASK-001 -->
<!-- estimate: 2d -->
<!-- assignee: ai-agent -->
- [ ] Design enhanced structure
- [ ] Implement task parser
- [ ] Create validation rules
<!-- discovered: Added during implementation -->
- [ ] Update documentation

## Backlog
### [MEDIUM] Refactor: Consolidate SDLC
<!-- id: TASK-002 -->
<!-- blocked-by: TASK-001 -->
- [ ] Move directories to SDLC/
- [ ] Update all references

## Completed
### âœ“ Setup Bootstrap Framework
<!-- completed: 2025-01-10 -->
- [x] Initial structure
- [x] Core rules
```

## TASK COMMANDS:

Create `.claude/commands/task-management.md`:
- `/task add [priority] [title]` - Add new task with metadata
- `/task update [id] [status]` - Update task status
- `/task validate` - Check task consistency
- `/task report` - Generate progress summary

## MIGRATION STEPS:

1. Audit current TASK.md for all existing tasks
2. Identify completed tasks that aren't properly marked
3. Find duplicate or obsolete tasks to remove
4. Reorganize tasks into appropriate categories
5. Add section headers (Active Sprint, Backlog, Completed)
6. Add priority tags based on importance
7. Generate unique IDs for all tasks
8. Add metadata comments (estimates, dependencies)
9. Create task management commands
10. Document the new structure

## TASK AUDIT REQUIREMENTS:

During migration, evaluate each task for:
- **Completion Status**: Is this actually done but not marked?
- **Relevance**: Is this still needed or obsolete?
- **Duplication**: Does this duplicate another task?
- **Category**: Is this in the right section?
- **Priority**: What's the actual priority?
- **Dependencies**: What must be done first?

## BENEFITS:

- Clean slate with properly organized tasks
- Eliminates task debt and confusion
- Better visibility into actual work remaining
- Unique IDs enable cross-referencing
- Estimates help with planning
- Priority-based organization
- Compatible with GitHub's task list rendering
- Maintains token efficiency advantage
