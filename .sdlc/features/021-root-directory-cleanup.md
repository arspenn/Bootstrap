**Date**: 2025-09-02
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Design Phase
**INVEST Score**: I:✓ N:✓ V:✓ E:✓ S:✓ T:✓
**Ambiguity Level**: Low
**Completeness**: 100%

## User Story

As a developer
I want to clean up the project root directory
So that the repository is organized and only contains essential files

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Remove Obsolete Directories
- **Given** obsolete directories exist in the root
- **When** I execute the cleanup
- **Then** benchmarks/, docs/, PRPs/, scripts/, and tests/ directories are deleted

### Scenario 2: Remove Obsolete Files
- **Given** obsolete template file exists
- **When** I execute the cleanup
- **Then** FEATURE_TEMPLATE.md is deleted

### Scenario 3: Update .gitignore
- **Given** responses/ directory contains informal historical files
- **When** I update .gitignore
- **Then** responses/ directory is ignored by git but preserved

## Boundaries and Constraints

### Out of Scope
- Moving or modifying core documentation files (README, LICENSE, ROADMAP, etc.)
- Cleaning temp/ directory (already in .gitignore)
- Creating new testing framework
- Preserving any content from docs/ folder

### In Scope
- Deleting obsolete test files
- Deleting unused scripts
- Deleting entire docs/ folder
- Deleting empty directories
- Deleting obsolete templates
- Adding responses/ to .gitignore
- Documenting the cleanup

## Dependencies

### Requires (Upstream)
- SDLC consolidation completed
- Template consolidation completed

### Required By (Downstream)
- Alpha release preparation
- Future testing framework implementation

## Additional Context

This cleanup is part of preparing for the alpha release. The existing tests are not effective unit tests and will be replaced with scenario-based testing for Claude commands and rules in the future. The scripts directory contains tools we don't use. Historical records are preserved in git history.

## Technical Considerations

- Use git rm for tracked files to preserve history
- Ensure .gitignore is properly formatted
- Verify no active code depends on removed directories
- Document what was removed and why

## Open Questions

None - requirements are clear.
