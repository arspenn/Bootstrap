# Tests Folder Structure

## Purpose
This folder contains all automated tests for the Bootstrap project, including unit tests, integration tests, and any test utilities.

## Structure
```
tests/
├── unit/                   # Unit tests (OPTIONAL)
├── integration/            # Integration tests (OPTIONAL)
├── fixtures/               # Test data and fixtures (OPTIONAL)
└── conftest.py            # Pytest configuration (OPTIONAL)
```

## Naming Conventions
- Pattern: `test_{module_name}.py`
- Examples: 
  - test_changelog_manager.py
  - test_git_controller.py
  - test_design_validator.py

## Required Contents
- Tests should mirror the structure of the main codebase
- Each test file should test a corresponding module
- Use pytest as the testing framework

## Relationship to Other Folders
- **Source Code**: Tests validate functionality in the main codebase
- **Designs**: Test requirements often specified in design documents
- **Tasks**: Test creation and updates tracked in TASK.md

## ⚠️ UNDEFINED STRUCTURE WARNING ⚠️
**The specific test organization and standards need definition. Please update during implementation.**
- Define unit vs integration test structure
- Establish naming conventions for test files
- Document test coverage requirements
- Specify test data management approach
