# AI Transparency Statement

## AI-Assisted Development

This project was developed with assistance from Claude AI (Anthropic). The AI helped with:

- Creating the design-feature command structure
- Developing the workflow documentation
- Generating templates and examples
- Writing test files
- Structuring the repository

## Human Oversight

All code and documentation were reviewed and approved by human developers. The AI served as a collaborative tool to accelerate development while maintaining quality and coherence.

## Purpose

This transparency statement is provided to acknowledge the role of AI in this project's development and to maintain openness about the tools and methods used in creating this software.

## Modifications

Users are encouraged to modify, extend, and adapt this bootstrap template for their own projects. The AI-assisted foundation provides a starting point that can be customized to meet specific needs.
